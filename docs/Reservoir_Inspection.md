!!!Caution 
	- Water storage levels will be affected. Watch clearwell and reservoir levels very carefully. Do not overfill the clearwell or the reservoirs.  
	- Contact time with chlorine will be affected during this process.  
	- Valve operation and possible changes to low lift pumps may cause an increase in turbidity.

**Steps to drain and fill reservoir for inspection:**

1.	Get proper equipment to turn reservoir valves. At the time this document was prepared, this equipment is borrowed from the City of Glendale and is called the “Power Walk.” Valves can also be turned manually using standard valve key. Valves have to be turned clockwise to close and counter clockwise to open.  
<br />

2.	Identify all of the following valves on drawings and mark/note their corresponding location outside.  
	1. NW Reservoir - Influent - 42 turns
	2. NW Reservoir - Effluent - 43.9 turns  

3.	Leaving all reservoir valves open. Put the raw water pump to lowest possible speed (raw #2 or #4). Drain the reservoir level down to about 6 to 8 feet of water. This process will take about 24 to 36 hours to accomplish.  
<br /> 

4.	When reservoirs are pumped down to required height. Close first the influent valve and then the effluent valve to the northwest reservoir. Monitor water quality coming out of reservoirs. If there is an increase in turbidity initially, it is probably due to rust coming off of valves. Note if turbidity increases during operational events or during rain events. Turbidity should be monitored by grab samples once every hour by staff until turbidity is confirmed to be stable and normal. Increases to turbidity during operational events and rain events may indicate a problem within the non-draining 
reservoirs.  
<br />

5.	After reservoir has been isolated. Turn up the speed of the raw water pump in service and fill the open reservoirs up to required height (approx. 14 feet) for normal daily operation.  
<br />

6.	Open the west hatch cover of the northwest reservoir (this hatch does not have the reservoir height sensing equipment mounted in it). Set up the gantry, run pump, necessary power and hoses to pump the remaining water out of the reservoir. (Note: there will still be about a foot of water in the reservoir when the reservoir is considered to be drained.)  
<br />

7.	Optional:  When draining reservoir is drained. Do a walk through inspection of reservoir. You will need: knee high rubber boats, flashlight, air quality monitor and confine space equipment.  
<br />

8.	After reservoir has been inspected by NSWC employees and there are no need for repairs. Schedule an inspection, from an independent contractor. This is normally scheduled prior to draining reservoir.  
<br />

9.	After the reservoir has passed inspection. The reservoir needs to be chlorinated, refilled and pass a colilert test before opening up the valves and putting back into service.  
<br />

10.	At the same time reservoir is being filled and chlorinated. The clearwell chlorine residual set point should be lowered to about 2.40 ppm. This will help keep the combined total chlorine residual lower when the northeast reservoir valves are opened and the water, with the higher chlorine residual, is mixed  with the water from the other 3 basins.  
<br />

11.	To chlorinate the reservoir, you will need: peristaltic pump capable of pumping 17 gal/day, ⅜” plastic tubing, 100 gal tank with 43 gals of sodium hypochlorite, 1 ½” diameter clean fire hose and plastic premade injector/discharge tee. Attach the pump and the hypochlorite tank to the plastic tee using ⅜” plastic tubing. Attach fire hose to nearest fire hydrant and then to the plastic tee. With the pump set up to feed the hypochlorite into the water supply, open up fire hydrant all the way and turn on pump to feed 17 gal/day. Let water and hypo pump run for approximately 3 days or over a weekend until there is about 5 feet of water in reservoir. There should be about a 20 ppm residual of chlorine in the reservoir. Test the water to make sure that the required chlorine residual has been met.  
<br />

12.	After required chlorine residual has been met. Fill the reservoir to 12 feet. (Note: Before filling reservoir, make sure the height of the other reservoirs in service are higher than 13 feet.) To fill the northwest reservoir open the influent valve 42 turns. Then open the effluent valve about 10 turns. Let the reservoir fill with high service water. When required height is met. Close the effluent valve and then the influent valve.  
<br />

13.	Let the reservoir sit for 24 hours.  
<br />

14.	After the 24 hours, test the chlorine residual in the reservoir. Chlorine residual must be below 10 ppm to run a colilert test. Let reservoir sit until required chlorine residual has been obtained.  
<br />

15.	After chlorine residual has dropped below 10 ppm. Collect sample for the colilert test. Collect the sample using a submersible pump and clean plastic tubing. Place submersible pump into reservoir and let run for about one hour. Then collect 100 ml sample of the reservoir water into a sterilized Idexx collection bottle. Run one colilert test, two consecutive days.  
<br />

16.	After the reservoir has passed the colilert tests and the chlorine residual is about 7 ppm, the influent valve can now be opened 42 turns. Allow the reservoir to reach the same height as the reservoirs in service.   
<br />

17.	When reservoir heights have equalized. Open the effluent valve about 7 turns. This will allow the higher chlorine levels to mix with the high service reservoir water.  
<br /> 

18.	Monitor high service chlorine residual. Residual must not exceed 4 ppm. Optimally residual should not go higher than 3 ppm. Open or close effluent valve to get optimal chlorine residual. Once chlorine residual is obtained, maintain the valve position and monitor the high service chlorine residual until residual has come down to normal levels about 2.50 ppm. This process may take between 1 to 7 days to achieve depending on the high service demand and chlorine residual of the water in the northwest reservoir.  
<br />

19.	When normal chlorine residuals are reached, slowly open the effluent valve (one turn at a time) until high service chlorine residual raises again. Then repeat step 17 until the effluent valve is fully open.
