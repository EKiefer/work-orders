    5. Energize *line A* by throwing switch.  
    6. Put lock back on switch for *line A*.  
    7. Return to motor room and untie buses. Each bus should now be connected to its own line.  
    8. Perform bus tie procedure so that "other" line is tied to both buses. This line will be referred to as *Line B*.  
    9. Remove lock from *Line B* switch.  
    10. De-engerize *Line B* by throwing switch.  
    11. Put lock back on switch for *Line B*.  
    12. Put lock back on fence.  
    13. Ensure configuration is correct and turn off generator.
