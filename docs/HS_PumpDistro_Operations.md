### Introduction
After treatment, the Commission is responsible for pumping potable water to our member communities. Although distribution storage facilities are not under the care of the Commission, we are responsible for operating its valves and pumps to regulate pressure while reserving a portion of the tank for fire protection. Maintaining distribution pressure is essential to operations. Too much pressure can lead to main breaks or equipment damage; not enough pressure can lead to customer complaints and diminished fire protection; quick changes (high or low) can cause water hammer- a force that causes main breaks. 

Two additional aspects of operations is energy usage and water quality. Various pumps and valves typically operate strategically to minimize electrical demand fees. While running equipment, we also need to be cognizant of water age- water in our storage facilities needs to "turn over" to prevent a deterioration in water quality. If a tower is out of service for an extended period of time, it may not be potable and may require disposal. 

In operating such equipment, one should note that individual pieces of equipment can operate in manual or auto. For instance, high service pump #1 can be set to run in manual at a specific speed (keypad); it can also run in auto to change the speed to meet a pressure setpoint. Because of the complexity of the entire system, there are "global" settings designed to mitigate operational problems. These global settings are managed through schedules.

### Operational Warnings
The following equipment/infrastructure are affected (note- this list may not be exhaustive):

- High service pumps 1-5
- Backwash pumps 1-2
- Surge relief valve (high service 5 to clearwell)
- WFB fill valve and pump
- Glendale fill valve and pumpt
- FPT fill valves and pumps
- Interconnections at Green Tree, Henry Clay, and School Road

### Personal Safety
All operations occur via SCADA system or local operator interfaces. There is no need to wear protective equipment unless there are special circumstances.

### Standard Operating Procedure
Proper operation is driven by constraints or "targets." Consequently, more than one approach may result in the correct outcome. Listed below are the constraints imposed on the Operator. Please click on link to see a spreadsheet listing the relationships between actions and predicable outcomes: HIGH SERVICE PUMPING AND DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS SPREADSHEET. 

- Plant discharge pressure target (Priority Level 1) -- Maintain pressure between 80 and 85 PSI at all times
- Fox Point tank pressure target (Priority Level 2) -- Maintain pressure between 46 and 62 PSI. 
- Glendale tank pressure target (Priority Level 2) -- Maintain pressure between 30 and 50 PSI. 
- Whitefish Bay tank pressure target (Priority Level 2) -- Maintain pressure between 62 and 70 PSI. 
- Plant storage target (Priority Level 2) -- Maintain reservoir level between 9.5 and 15.0 feet
- Fox Point storage target (Priority Level 2) -- Maintain tank level between 10 and 23 feet
- Glendale storage target (Priority Level 2) -- Maintain tank level between 40 and 78 feet
- Whitefish Bay storage target (Priority Level 2) -- Maintain tank level between 10 and 23 feet
- Plant energy demand target (Priority Level 3) -- Maintain energy use to be at or lower than 300 kw from 10am and 10pm (M-F) at lower demand periods- Bender facility. During summer months, minimize on-demand power consumption. 
- Fox Point energy demand target (Priority Level 5) -- none -- use as needed
- Glendale energy demand target (Priority Level 5) -- none -- use as needed
- Whitefish Bay energy demand target (Priority Level 5) -- none -- use as needed

<u> Standard Operating Techniques </u>

The distribution system is comprised of many different types of equipment and mains. Some of the infrastructure is old and brittle while other parts are new and robust. To minimize damage, the following operating techniques must be observed:

- Distribution Valve Operation

The valves controlled by the NSWC can be remotely operated (i.e. electric actuators controlled by SCADA system). Opening and closing a distribution valve will cause a pressure change- locally and globally. When changing the valve position, the Operator must control motion to prevent large changes in pressure. In auto, the SCADA system regulates motion without further operator interaction. In manual, operators must control motion by modulating the valve open percentage by 1% per 30 seconds (or slower). 

- Plant Valve Operation

The plant valves associated with the high service pumps are normally controlled automatically. In the past, operators have noted problems with these valves, especially those associated with high service pumps 2 and 3. In the event of control failure, operators must use the controls at the valve actuators. If you intend to start the pump, the valve actuator must be opened after pump start-up. If you intend to stop the pump, the valve actuator must be closed before pump shut-down. If this order is not used, water will flow through the pump backwards and potentially cause damage. 

- High Service Pump Operation

When in auto, the pump designated as Rank 1 will be running or called to run. This pump will operate from its minimum speed to its maximum speed in order to meet the target discharge pressure. If Rank 1 pump cannot meet the target pressure, Rank 2 pump is called to run. If the Rank 2 pump do3es not start or cannot sustain the pressure, the next higher pump rank will start. This process repeats until enough pumps are on to handle demand. 

If pressure settings and/or schedules are adjusted, care must be taken to prevent unnecessary start and stopping of pumps as this will cause a transient pressure spike. Direct (manual operation) or indirect (SCADA setting) pump changes should be made in such a way to limit the frequency of pump changes to less than 1 pump change per 60 minutes under normal circumstances and 1 pump change per 5 minutes under extraordinary circumstances. 

In the event of an extraordinary event (power outage, malfunction, etc.) it is expected that an operator will make every effort to restore high service pressure to the target range as quickly as possible- even if this means frequent pump changes. 

- Distribution Pump Operation

When in auto, the pumps will start and stop according to the various settings and schedules associated with each utility. In general, the pump and fill valve operate at different times: the fill valve is modulating when the pump is off and vice versa. Like any other pump, starting and stopping the pump will cause a transient pressure spike. Pump changes should be made in such a way to limit the frequency of pump changes to less than 1 pump change per 60 minutes under normal circumstances and 5 minutes under extraordinary circumstances. 

Under very rare circumstances, the high service pumps may be isolated to deal with equipment downstream. In these rare events, it will be necessary to run the entire system off distribution pumps. 

- Energy Management

Energy management is important in our attempt to minimize electical cost. Various setting and schedules are designed not only to address water storage and pressure issues, they are designed to minimize electrical consumption. Every attempt should be made to use 300kW or less while on-peak at the Bender facility (low demand periods). We are charged a fee for every kW that exceeds 300- done on a monthly basis. Every attempt should be made to use the least amount of energy at Klode (there is no kW target at Klode). 

Both Bender and Klode facilities are charged a fee based on the greatest electrical demand over the past 12 months- regardless of on-peak or off-peak. In other words, running an extra 100 kW for 10 minutes could result in elevated fees for an entire year!

Stategies for minimizing elecrical demand include: using the towers to steady the flow, starting and stopping equipment off-peak (i.e. UV system), filling towers at night, avoid pump maintenance/testing during on-peak, running the generator whenever there is an expectation of high energy use, and running one high pump whenever possible (do not run additional high service pumps during on-peak unless absolutely necessary). 

Note- on-peak at Bender is from 10:00am to 10:00pm, Monday through Friday. On-peak at Klode is 9:00am to 9:00pm, Mondary through Friday. Posted holidays are excluded from on-peak periods.
