### Introduction
The detergent test is a storm water analysis that detects if there has been any illegal discharge in the storm water effluent. This test is done by using the detergent kit, which is user friendly. It lessens the amount of solvent needed and also eliminates personal contact with chemicals.

### Summary
This method requires the employee to collect storm water samples to be tested for illegal discharges in the storm water effluent by using the detergent testing kit.

### Materials & Equipment Needed
- Storm Water samples
- Detergent Test Kit
- Disposable Bottle
- Storm Water Analysis Book
***

### Procedure
1. Rinse the reaction tube with the sample to be tested. Then fill it to the 5 mL mark with the sample.
2. Hold the double-tipped amboule (Blue Solution) in a vertical position.
- Snap the upper tip using the blue tip breaking tool.
- Flip amboule over and break the other tip, allowing the blue detergent empty into the reaction tube.
**Throw detergent tube when empty into the disposable bottle.**
3. Cap the reaction tube and shake it vigorously for 30 seconds.
- Allow the tube to sit for 1 minute.
4. Take the smaller amboule and make sure the flexible tubing is attached firmly to the tip.
5. Insert the amboule (Tubing First) into the reaction tube so that the tubing is at the bottom (Clear Solution).
6. Break the amboule tip by gently pressing it against the side of the reaction tube.
- The amboule will draw fluid only from the organic phase (Bottom Layer).
- Once filling is complete remove the amboule from the reaction tube
**remove the flexible tubing from the amboule and place in disposable bottle.**
7. Wipe all liquid from the outside of the tube and place a white amboule cap onto the tip (Small yellow envelope).
- Invert the amboule 2-3 times, allowing the bubble to travel from one end to the other.
8. Receive a test result by placing the amboule (flat end first) into the comparator.
- Hold the comparator up toward the light and view the bottom.
- Rotate the comparator until the best color match is found.
**For example if the color is found in between 0 and 1 but more towards 1, you would put that it was <0 and > than 1.
- Write test results in the Storm Analysis Book.
9. Once test is finished and a result is found, dispense solution contained in the reaction tube into the disposable bottle.
- Rinse out the reaction tube with reagent (Distilled) water and place back into the Detergent kit.
