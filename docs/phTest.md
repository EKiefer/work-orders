### Introduction
pH is a measure of how acidic or basic water is. The scale goes from 0 - 14, with 7 being neutral. A pH reading of less than 7 indicates acidity, whereas a pH of greater than 7 indicates a base.
***

### Summary
This procedure involves calibrating the pH meter and testing both a raw and tap water sample.
***

### Materials & Equipment Needed
- Thermo Orion meter (fluoride & pH)

- pH probe

- Temperature probe

- Hot plate

- pH buffer(4 & 7 standard)

- 5 small cups

- 4 small mixing magnets

- Reagent grade water

- Tap, raw, or distribution water sample
***

### Personal Safety
Wash hands thoroughly once you are done using the pH buffers.
***

### Operation Warnings
None. 
***

### Special Notes
Every time the pH meter is calibrated, the results need to be logged in a book along with the date, lot number from each buffer's box , and your initials.

### Procedure
1. The first step you will have to do is to collect your samples and allow it to warm to room temperature. Then turn on your Thermo Orion meter which can be used to read many different things but for this test you will want to make sure that the pH cable that connects to the prob is hooked up to the back of the meter. Turn on the meter and press either the up or down arrow until the meter is reading pH.  
<br />

- Once you've done this you will take the 4 mixing magnets and place one into four of the small cups. Two of these cups will be for your samples, one for one buffer , and the final for the other buffer. The two cups for the buffers may be filled about half way at this time. Again one of the cups gets filled halfway with the 4 buffer which is red in color and the other with 7 buffer which is yellow in color.  
<br />

- Before preforming the test you must calibrate the meter to ensure accurate results. Remove the probe from the electrode storage solution and rinse off both the pH and temperature probes using the reagent grade water while collecting the waste water with one of the empty cups. Place the cup with the 4 buffer onto the hotplate but for this procedure you will only be using the magnetic mixer dial and not the heating element. On the meter you will press the calibrate button and place the probe into the buffer. The probe will take a little time to calibrate but should finish very closely to 4.0 but might differ from buffer lots . Once it has reached 4.0  you will press the calibration button again so the meter knows that you are calibrating with a second buffer now. Remove the probe from the 4 buffer and rinse. Now place the 7 buffer cup onto the hotplate and insert the probe into the buffer. Again this will take a little time to calibrate but should finish very closely to 7.0 and once it does you will press the save/measure and print button. Remove probe from the buffer solution and rinse off again. You are ready to begin testing your sample.  
<br />

- Now that the meter is calibrated you can ready your samples. In order to get your samples ready you will need to fill one of your small cups about half way with your raw water sample and the other about half way with your tap water sample. Place either sample cup onto the hotplate first and insert both probes. The meter will read the sample until the pH symbol stops blinking. Even after the symbol stops blinking it is wise to allow some time to pass with both probes still in the sample in case the pH might move around. After you've recorded your first sample, remove both probes and rinse with the reagent grade water. Now you are ready for your next sample. Just like before place both probes into your sample and wait to record your data. Once the data is recorded remove both probes from the sample and rinse. Place only the pH probe back into its storage solution.
