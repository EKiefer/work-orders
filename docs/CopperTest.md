### Introduction
The copper test is a storm water analysis that detects the amount off copper that is present in the water.This test is done by using the metals prep test and also the copper test.
***

### Summary
This storm water analysis requires the employee to collect storm water samples and analyze the amount of copper present, using the metals prep test and doing a copper test. Results are then recorded in the storm water analysis book.

### Procedure

Metals Prep Test

1. Turn on the Hach DRB 200 Reactor to heat up to 100 degrees Celsius
2. Pipet 10mL of the storm water sample into the reaction tube
3. Add 1mL of solution A to the reaction tube
4. Add 2 leveled out spoon fulls of reagent B
5. Cap the reaction tube and then invert it 2 to 3 times.
6. Place the reaction tube into the reactor for 1 hour at 100 degrees celsius
- After 1 hour allow the test to tube to cool down until it is cool to touch
7. Pipet 1mL of solution C into the reaction tube
8. Cap test tube and invert it 2 to 3 times. Now it is ready for the Copper test kit.


Copper Test Kit

1. Add 2mL of sample to the copper reaction tube
2. Place cap back on and invert 2 to 3 times or until the white powder is diluted.
3. Wait 3  minutes
4. Place the copper test tube into the DR 5000 to obtain a result
5. Once a result is obtained, record it in the storm water analysis book.
