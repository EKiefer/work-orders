###Introduction
The Safe Drinking water Act (SDWA), gives EPA the authority to protect the public from chemical, physical, radiological, and microbiological contaminants in their drinking water. EPA has used this authority to develop regulations establishing maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for many substances that can be harmful in drinking water and treatment technique regulations requiring public water systems to remove or inactivate other substances found in their source water. Other SDWA regulations are intended to protect the quality of source water and to ensure treated drinking water remains safe until it is delivered to consumers.
	
The EPA requires continuous monitoring of some values while allowing intermittent monitoring for others values.
