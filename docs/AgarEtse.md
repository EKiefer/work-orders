- Gently and slowly disperse standard powder in the water.
- Let it boil to 100 deg.
- While boiling get you tubes, scale, dispenser station pump and tubes holder ready because when the agar boil to 100 deg you are going to start pumping it in the tubes to avoid solidification which can easily occur when agar start cooling down. First weigh empty tubes then fill them up means you should have 10 g to 12 g in every single tubes.
- When done filling up tubes gently place caps on them let them cool down for few minutes.
- Take one tube pour the agar in sterilize plate swirl it let it sit to cool down and use it for pH  test
- Next place the tubes rack in the Autoclave to sterilize. Turn printer, thermometer and  autoclave on press Liquid bottom and Enter then wait for this process till done while doing paper work.
- When autoclave procedure complete, remove agar from autoclave let tubes sit and cool down then incubate.
