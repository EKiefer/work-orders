### Introduction
When the Chlorine buffer and the chlorine Indicator become low, they need to be switched out and replaced with new and full bottles. The chlorine analyzer then needs to be re calibrated with a chlorine residual analysis sample done in the lab. The value from the results are taken and entered into the chemical analyzer (CL 17).
***

### Summary
This method requires employee to collect a water sample, add the appropriate DPD-based chemical, and use the DR5000 to measure the chlorine residual.
***

### Materials & Equipment Needed
- DR5000 (instrument)
- 1 cm x 1 cm cuvette
- DPD Reagent (free OR total)
- Lint-free wipe / tissue that does not scratch plastic
- CL 17 Chlorine Analyzer
- Free Chlorine Buffer
- Free Chlorine Indicator
- DPD Compound
***

### Personal Safety
This procedure uses a product called DPD. Make sure that the DPD is added to the correct bottle. If the DPD is placed into the wrong bottle, the reading will be incorrect

Checking chlorine residual with this instrument will not affect any other process.

### Operation Warnings
None

### Special Notes
All Reagents are located downstairs in the storage area. When using and opening new products, make sure they are taken out of inventory on the computer.

### Procedure
This procedure assumes Hach DR5000 instrument is in good working order and the that method is set to  "954 CL".

1. Use clean beaker to collect a sample of water (Reservoir Water).  For convenience, sample should be approximately 20 mL, but can be less.
2. If the instrument needs to be zero'ed, fill up clean cuvette to top with water from beaker, insert cuvette into instrument, and press the "zero" button.
3. Use pipettor(also referred to as a pipet) to draw 5 mL.
4. Dispose of remaining water in beaker (leave 5 mL in pipettor).
5. Dispense the water in pipettor to beaker.
6. Do the  free chlorine analysis, using the DPD reagent labelled for use with free chlorine.
7. Open packet of reagent with scissors or by tearing with fingers.
8. Dump reagent into beaker with water.
9. Free chlorine analysis, swirl to mix and wait no more than 1 minute. If everything is working correctly, the water should turn pink if there is chlorine in the sample.
10. After the appropriate amount of time has passed, pour sample into cuvette (remember to use an empty cuvette).
11. To ensure any residual water in cuvette does not dilute sample, pour sample from cuvette to beaker and then from beaker to cuvette.
12. Press the read button on the instrument.
13. Record the value shown on the screen.


Changing the Chlorine Analyzer (CL 17)

1. Out of the two Chlorine Containers
	1. Free Chlorine Buffer
	2. Free Chlorine Indicator
		- Add the DPD compound into the Chlorine Indicator solution bottle.
2. Shake the bottle to mix the DPD and the Chlorine Indicator.
3. Open the CL 17 box and take the leftover chlorine indicator and add it to the full chlorine indicator to fill it up more. Place cap tightly on the new bottle and place it back into the CL 17
4. Do the same third step for the Chlorine Buffer.

Calibrating the Chlorine Analyzer (CL 17)

1. Go onto the computer using the SCADA system and click on the CLR on the left side of the overview screen and then click Toggle CI.
2. Enter the setup menu by pressing the MENU key and then the UP arrow key until you see SETUP, and press ENTER.
3. Press the DOWN arrow key until CAL STD is displayed. Press ENTER
	1. **Current measured value is displayed***
4. Press ENTER and edit the value by pressing the RIGHT or LEFT arrow key to move to the next number. Use the UP and DOWN arrow to change the number. Match the value from the free chlorine analysis.
5. Press EXT key 3 times to return to the normal display mode.
