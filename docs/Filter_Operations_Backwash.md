### Introduction
Backwashing filters is important to the water treatment process, it cleans the filter riding it of flocculation matter that is collected during operation.  This allows the filters to operation at their maximum efficiency level.  In the following are instructions for backwashing a filter in “Auto Control” and “Manual Control.”  The “Auto Control” backwash process is ran by the SCADA system.  A “Manual Control” backwash process is ran by the operator at the filter control council through the hand controls.

### Operation Warnings
Before backwashing a filter make sure there is plenty of room for the effluent water in the reclaim well.  While backwashing a filter the operator may get a “Control Failure” alarm from a piece of equipment not working properly, the operator should hit the red “Emergency Stop” button to stop the backwash process.

### Personal Safety
All operations occur via SCADA system or local operator interfaces. There is no need to wear protective equipment unless there are special circumstances.

### Standard Operating Procedure

**Backwashing a Filter in Auto Control**

1. Looking at the control council of the filter to be backwashed, put the black hand switch for the filter control under the “FCC - #” label in “Remote” control and the Right and Left Cell Backwash valves in “Auto” control.  
<br />

2. On the screen of the control council, tap the “Menu” tab which will bring up the filter control functions then tap the “Backwash” tab to bring up the backwash sequence.   
<br />

3. Push the “Initiate Backwash” button on the left side of the control council.  This will start the backwash process, working through the timed 20 step backwash sequence.  
<br/>

4. While the filter is backwashing, visually inspect the left and right side of the filter taking note of how all equipment works(i.e. pumps, valves, lights and sandwash arms), media, appearance, and flow rate.   
<br />

5. After the backwash process is finished, complete both the “Filter Worksheet” found on the google docs “Drive” page and the “Filter Operations” information found on the google docs “Sites” page under the “Filter” setting.  Make sure to include all data and report any type of problems that occurred with the equipment.  
<br />   


**Backwashing a Filter in Manual Control**

1. Looking at the control council of the filter to be backwashed, put the filter settings in “Local” control and the Right and Left cell backwash valves in “Manual” control.  
<br />

2. On the screen of the control council, tap the “Menu” tab which will bring up the filter control functions then tap the “Backwash” tab to bring up the backwash sequence.

	*If the filter is already drained to the appropriate level start at step 5 in the backwash sequence.  While working through the backwash process, visually inspect the left and right side of the filter taking note of how all equipment works(i.e. pumps, valves, lights and sandwash arms), media, appearance, and flow rate.  
	<br />

3. (60 seconds) - Push the green “Open Valve” button under the “Filter Drain Valve” label to open the filter drain valve.  
<br />

4. (150 seconds) - Push the green “Open Valve” button under the “Left Cell Sandwash Valve” label to start the left cell sandwash arms at the time limit push the red “Close Valve” button under the “Left Cell Sandwash Valve” label to stop the left cell sandwash arms.  
<br />

5. (150 seconds) - Push the green “Open Valve” button under the “Right Cell Sandwash Valve” label to start the right cell sandwash arms then push the red “Close Valve” button under the “Right Cell Sandwash Valve” label to stop the right cell sandwash arms.  
<br />

6. (30 seconds) Turn the black dial under the “Left Cell Backwash Valve” label to a low flow setting, then push the green “Open Valve” button under the “Washwater Pump” to turn on the backwash pump.  
<br />

7. (30 seconds) Turn the black dial under the “Left Cell Backwash Valve” label to a medium flow setting.  
<br />

8. (120 seconds) Turn the black dial under the “Left Cell Backwash Valve” label to a high flow setting, then push the green “Open Valve” button under the “Left Cell Sandwash Valve” label to turn on the left cell sandwash arms.  
<br />

9. (120 seconds) Leave the left cell backwash valve at the high flow setting, push the red “Close Valve” button under the “Left Cell Sandwash Valve” label to turn off the left cell sandwash arms.  
<br />

10. (30 seconds) Turn the black dial under the “Left Cell Backwash Valve” label to a medium flow setting.  
<br />

11. (30 seconds) Turn the black dial under the “Left Cell Backwash Valve” label to a low flow setting.  
<br />

12. (30 seconds) Keeping the left cell backwash valve at a low flow setting, turn the black dial under the “Right Cell Backwash Valve” label to a low flow setting.  
<br />

13. (30 seconds) Turn the black dial under the “Left Cell Backwash Valve” label to the off setting, while turning the black dial under the “Right Cell Backwash Valve” label to a medium flow setting.  
<br />

14. (120 seconds) Turn the black dial under the “Right Cell Backwash Valve” label to a high flow setting, then push the green “Open Valve” button under the “Right Cell Sandwash Valve” label to turn on the right cell sandwash arms.  
<br />

15. (120 seconds) Leave the right cell backwash valve at the high flow setting, push the red “Close Valve” button under the “Right Cell Sandwash Valve” label to turn off the right cell sandwash arms.  
<br />

16. (30 seconds) Turn the black dial under the “Right Cell Backwash Valve” label to medium flow setting.  
<br />

17. (30 seconds) Turn the black dial under the “Right Cell Backwash Valve” label to a low flow setting.  
<br />

18. (10 seconds) Push the red “Close Valve” button under the “Washwater Pump” label to turn off the washwater pump.  
<br />

19. (65 seconds) Turn the black dial under the “Right Cell Backwash Valve” label to the off setting and pause to drain the remaining washwater from the filter.  
<br />

20. (10 seconds) Push the red “Close Valve” button under the “Filter Drain Valve” label to close the drain.  
<br />

21. Push the green “Open Valve” button under the “Settled Water Filter Influent Valve” label to open the settled water valve which will fill the filter.  Do this step in multiple stages to fill the filter to the appropriate level.  
<br />

22. After the backwash process is finished, complete both the “Filter Worksheet” found on the google docs “Drive“ page and the “Filter Operations” information found on the google docs “Sites” page found under the “Filter” setting.  Make sure to include all data and report any type of problems that occurred with the equipment.

### Special Notes

- Each filter is equipped with a set of flood lights to aid in visually inspecting the filter during the backwash process.

- While the filter is running through the backwash process the operator should use one of the hoses located in the middle isle way to wash down the beams and pipe on each side.
