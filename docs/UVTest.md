### Introduction
The HACH DR5000 is a benchtop instrument that is used to measure many different lab tests, one of them being the daily UV test.
***

### Summary
This method requires employee to collect a clearwell water sample in the quartz cuvette and use the DR5000 to measure for UV. Other methods are available, but this method will be discussed in this section.
***

### Materials & Equipment Needed
- Hach DR5000 (instrument)

- 1 cm x 1 cm quartz cuvette

- Reagent Grade Water

- Lint-free wipe / tissue that does not scratch crystal
***

### Personal Safety
There are no personal safety concerns involved in this procedure.
***

### Operation Warnings
Testing UV with this instrument will not affect any other process.
***

### Special Notes
Be very careful handling crystal cuvette because it is very expensive. Also be sure to turn off UV lamp after test is preformed so it does not burn out.
***

### Procedure
This procedure assumes Hach DR5000 instrument is in good working order.

1. On the Hach DR5000 you need to get to the main menu screen. From there choose instrument set up option. Choose the lamp set up option and turn on the UV lamp. Give the lamp a few minutes to warm up or until you see the light bulb symbol on the top of the screen stop flashing.  
<br />

- Take the crystal cuvette and carefully empty the reagent grade water stored in it from previous testing. Fill with fresh reagent grade water for calibration.  
<br />

- Once the lamp is warmed up continue on the main menu screen with the single wave option. After choosing that there is a up arrow option on the lower right hand corner of the screen. Once pressed there will be a column of options, choose the percent transmittance option.  
<br />

- Slide hatch back and place cuvette into square slot. Then press the zero option on the bottom of the screen. Once zeroed the DR5000 should read 100% trans.  
<br />

- Remove cuvette and empty reagent grade water. Now fill cuvette with **<u>Pre-UV, Pre-Chlorine</u>** clearwell water sample. Carefully wipe off cuvette before placing it into the square slot inside the instrument. Once the cuvette is placed inside, close the hatch and press the read option on the screen. This will be your UV reading.  
<br />

- Empty the sample out of the cuvette and rinse with reagent grade water. Once rinsed, fill back up with reagent grade water and put cap back on the top for storage. Place cuvette into circular holder for next use. Follow directions to get back to UV lamp control screen and shut the lamp off.
