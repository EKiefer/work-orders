## Calculation Sheet for Chemical Transfers 
By: Eric Kiefer  <br />
Date: 03/30/2007
***
Factor A: (gallons of chemical / inch of chemical)  <br />
Factor B: (total pounds of chemical / gallon of chemical)  <br />
Factor C:  (active pounds / total pounds)  <br />
Tank Level Measurement: (inches of chemical in tank)  <br />
(Operator Reads Level)

Formula for all tanks except Fluoride Day Tank:

*ActivePounds = TankLevelDifference(inches) x FactorA x FactorB x Factor C*

Formula for Fluoride Day Tank:

*ActivePounds = TankPoundsMeasurement(lbs) x FactorC*

***

**Alum Bulk (using a single measurement for all three (3) tanks)**:  <br />
Factor A = 93.905  <br />
Factor B = 11.15  <br />
Factor C = 0.485  <br />

**Alum Day (using a single measurement for both tanks)**:  <br />
Factor A = 8.767  <br />
Factor B = 11.15  <br />
Factor C = 0.485  <br />

**Polyphosphate**:  <br />
Factor A = 8.13  <br />
Factor B = 11.31  <br />
Factor C = 1.00  <br />

**Hypochlorite / Settled / Day Tank**:  <br />
Factor A = 7.51  <br />
Factor B = 10.1  <br />
Factor C = 0.12  <br />

**Hypochlorite / Clearwell / Day Tank**:  <br />
Factor A = 5.91  <br />
Factor B = 10.1  <br />
Factor C = 0.12  <br />

**Hypochlorite Bulk (using a single measurement for both tanks)**:  <br />
Factor A = 83.33  <br />
Factor B = 10.1  <br />
Factor C = 0.12  <br />

**Fluoride Day**:  <br />
Factor C = 0.25  <br />

**Fluoride Bulk**:  <br />
Factor A = 83.33  <br />
Factor B = 10.25  <br />
Factor C = 0.25  <br />
 
Example - Polyphosphate

*ActivePounds = 1.25 x 8.13 x 11.31 x 1.00*  <br />
*ActivePounds = 114.9*
