###Introduction
The safety of drinking water supplied to the consumers by water treatment plant operators is dependent upon many factors: quality of raw water (surface water and/ or ground water), application of appropriate treatment technology/disinfection (as needed), and monitoring of treated/finished water within the water distribution system network. Appropriate treatment/disinfection technologies for both surface and ground water sources are identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in various regulations that were promulgated pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) of 1974 and its amendments. Although the treated water leaving a treatment plant typically meets EPAâ€™s water quality requirements, the water could undergo transformation within the various distribution system components (e.g., storage tanks and pipes), which alters the quality, potentially making it unsuitable for human consumption. To address these issues, EPA has developed specific regulations that mandate periodic monitoring of water quality within distribution systems. 

Distribution system sample collection is done according to Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 809 for safe drinking water. The number of samples required is proportionate to the population served, NSWC serves about 35,000 people, which means NSWC must take a minimum of 30 representative samples each month. Therefore distribution sampling is currently conducted 3 times per month on dates evenly spaced throughout the month at 16 representative locations spread throughout the 3 distribution systems.

###Operation Warnings
Ensure that samples are collected and analyzed according to current regulations, including the practice of proper aseptic techniques for bacterial sampling. You are a representative of the North Shore Water Commission when you are in the field collecting samples, ensure that your action reflect well.

###Personal Safety
Use common sense when acquiring samples.

###Standard Operating Procedure
<br />
**Procedure at each site:** 

- Turn on Hot water tap and allow to run for 2 minutes, turn on cold water tap and allow to run for 3 minutes, collect samples
	- Standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater, 22nd edition, samples section 9060 subsection A, 9-33
- Collect Cl sample and zero colorimeter with tap sample
	- Set colorimeter to CLP2 by pressing the mode key once
- Add total Cl buffer packet to sample, analyze results after 3 minutes 
- Record time of sample collection
- While waiting for Cl sample to react collect turbidity sample
- Take water temperature 
- Collect coliform bacteria sample in Idexx bottle and place in cooler, label lid with site, time, date and initials
- Record Cl reading 
- Clean up area
***

**Procedure upon return to lab:**
	**Bacteria samples:**

- Prepare and analyze 4 R2A plates in accordance with the guidelines in the SOP Bacteriological examination and quality (SOP Bacteriological Examination and Quality.docx)
	- Plates needed: Blank, sample sites 6, 12 and 13 (one from each distribution system)
	- Prepare plates from Idexx bottle samples before adding Colilert
- Prepare and analyze coliform bacteria samples in accordance with the guidelines in the SOP Bacteriological examination and quality (SOP Bacteriological Examination and Quality.docx)
	- Sample results need to be entered in WAMS see procedure bellow
