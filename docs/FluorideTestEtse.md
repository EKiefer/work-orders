### Introduction
Fluoride is a type of chemical that is added to drinking water in plants to help control  teeth decay and need to be monitor in a plants daily.
***

### Summary
This method requires employee to collect water samples from distribution system, tap. Add the appropriate TISAB II chemical use for fluoride test.
***

### Materials & Equipment Needed
Fluoride ISE probe (Ion Selective Electrode)
Tap water, distribution water ( depend on the water you are willing to test)
TISAB II
1 ppm and 10 ppm reagent use to calibrate the meter
Pipette ( 5 mL )
***

### Personal Safety
This procedure uses a product called TISAB II.
***

### Operation Warnings
Testing fluoride with this instrument will not affect any other process.
***

### Special Notes
None
***

### Procedure
1. First collect water samples Tap, distribution system samples
- Allow samples to warm up to room temperature
- Get 3 little and pour
- 1 ppm standard Fluoride solution
- 10 ppm standard Fluoride solution
- Turn meter on and press the down arrow until it reads ISE mg/L
- Make sure Fluoride probe is plugged into meter
- Get your 1 ppm standard and insert probe in press calibration and wait till reading stabilize and stop blinking.
- Press calibration then remove probe rinse it and get you 10 ppm standard and insert probe in wait till stop blinking go ahead and calibrate next press measure to save calibration.
- Remove probe and rinse it.
- Pipette 5 mL of water that you are testing for and 5 mL of TISAB II reagent
- Get your water sample and place probe in and wait till stop blinking to and read the result go ahead and do the same for all water that you are testing for but remember to rinse probe between samples.
