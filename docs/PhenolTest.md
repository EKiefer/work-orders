4. Mix the contents in the amboule by inverting it 2-3 times, allowing the bubble to move from one end to the other
- ** Dry the amboule and wait 1 minute for color development***
- **After the 1 minute color development, the color in the amboule may be more orange than the color standards. If this happens wait another 5 minutes for an improved color match.
5. Use either the low range or high range comparator to determine the level of phenol in the sample. if the color amboule is between two color standards, an estimate can be made.
