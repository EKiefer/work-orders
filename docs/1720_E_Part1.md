### Introduction
Hach 1720E turbidimeter is an online  instrument used to measure turbidity, which a measure of cloudiness. Plant staff need to monitor this instrument very closely to make sure it is functioning properly. The lab turbidimeter reading should match the value shown by this online instrument. Every 3 months, this instrument needs to be calibrated.
***

### Summary
This method requires employees to calibrate turbidimeter by using a 1-liter bottle of StablCal 20 NTU standard and one calibration cylinder.
***

### Materials & Equipment Needed
- 1720 E turbidimeter (instrument)
- 1-liter StablCal 20 NTU standard
- Calibration cylinder
- Lab soap
- Bleach (optional)
- Brush
- Distilled water
***

### Personal Safety
This procedure uses a product called StablCal 20 NTU standard. Check the MSDS or safety data sheet for personal safety data information.
***

### Operation Warnings
Before performing this calibration, the SCADA system should be set up to "control inhibit" this value. When the instrument is working properly, the "control inhibit" needs to be taken off.

### Special Notes
This is Part 1 of a 2-part series. Watch both parts for the whole procedure.

### Procedure
1. Turn off the sample flow to the turbidimeter.
2. Place a container underneath the turbidimeter body if you don't want the floor below to get wet--this step is optional. Remove the drain plug from the bottom of the body (release the lock on the bottom of the plug and move the plug back and forth to ease it out) and drain the turbidimeter body.
3. CAUTION: DO NOT GET LAMP WET WHEN DOING THIS STEP. Clean turbidimeter sensor with lab soap. If there is a microbiological growth on the instrument, use a little bleach. If using bleach, do not allow bleach to sit on sensor any longer than necessary and clean with lab soap again. Please remember that If the instrument is not clean, then the calibration procedure will not work properly.
4. After cleaning, replace the plug and lock it into place.
5. Gently invert a 1-liter bottle of 20.00 NTU StablCal. Invert carefully to avoid creating bubbles in the standard. Do not shake!
6. Carefully pour 1 liter of the 20.00 NTU StablCal standard into the turbidimeter calibration column.
7. Check the photocell for film or debris. Clean if necessary.
8. Place the turbidimeter head on the body. Make sure the head is seated properly by ensuring  it is lined up withe bubble trap cover.
9. Wait approximately 3-10 minutes for any bubbles to dissipate and the reading to stabilize.
10. Finally display value should be 20.00 NTU which will confirm calibration.
