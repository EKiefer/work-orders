### Introduction
Back washing filters  is very important to the water treatment process. It cleans the filter by getting rid of the flocculation matter that has been collected during the operation process. Being able to perform this allows the filters to operate at their maximum efficiency level. In the following are the instructions along with a visual on how to back wash a filter in "Manual Control"
***

### Summary
The "Manual Control" backwash process is ran by the operator at the filter control council, using the hand controls.
***

### Materials & Equipment Needed
- SCADA system
- Hose
- Filter Control Council
- Filter Worksheet
- Filter Operations
***

### Personal Safety
There is no need to wear protective equipment unless there are special circumstances in place.
***

### Operation Warnings
Before back washing a filter, make sure there is plenty of room for the effluent water in the reclaim well. While back washing a filter the operator on duty may receive a "Control Failure" alarm. This means that a piece of equipment is not working properly. The operator should hit the red "Emergency Stop" button to stop the backwash process.

### Procedure
1. Looking at the control council of the filter to be back washed, put the filter settings in "Local" control and the Right and Left cell backwash valves in "Manual" control.
2. On the screen of the control council, tap the "Menu" tab which will bring up the filter control functions then tap the "Backwash" tab to bring up the backwash sequence.
	1. **If the filter is already drained to the appropriate level start at step 5 in the backwash sequence. while working through the process, visually inspect the left and right side of the filter taking note of how all equipment works.***
	2. **Use the hose to wash down the filter sides,troth's and support bars to remove any excess dirt, algae etc. that might have built up since last backwash.
3. STEP 5:  If the filter is full, push the green "Open Valve" button under the "Filter Drain Valve" label to open the filter drain. (60 Seconds).
4. STEP 6: Push the green "Open Valve" button under the "Left Cell Sand-Wash Valve" label to start the left sand-wash arms. (150 Seconds)
	1. At the time limit, push the red "Close Valve" button under the "Left Cell Sand-Wash Valve" label to stop the left cell sand-wash arms.
5. STEP 7: Push the green" Open Valve" button under the "Right Cell Sand-Wash Valve" label to start the right cell sand-wash arms. (150 Seconds)
	1. At the time limit, push the red "Close Valve" button under the "Right Cell Sand-Wash Valve"label to stop the right cell sand-wash arms.
6. STEP 8:  Turn the black dial under the "Left Cell Backwash Valve" to a low flow setting or until the numbers start to change. (30 Seconds)
	1. Push the green "Open Valve" button under the "Wash-Water Pump" to turn on the backwash pump.
7. STEP 9: Turn the black dial under the "Left Cell Backwash Valve" label to a medium flow setting. (30 Seconds)
8. STEP 10: Turn the black dial under the "Left Cell Backwash Valve" label to a high flow setting.
	1. Push the green "Open Valve" button under the "Left Cell Sand-Wash Valve" label to turn on the left cell sand-wash arms. (120 Seconds)
	2. Leave the left cell backwash valve at the high flow setting, push the red "Close Valve" button under the "Left Cell Sand-wash Valve" label to turn off the left cell sand-wash arms.
9. STEP 11: Turn the black dial under the  "Left Cell Backwash Valve" label to a medium flow setting. (30 Seconds)
10. STEP 12: Turn the black dial under the "Left Cell Backwash Valve" label to a low flow setting. (30 Seconds)
11. STEP 13: Keeping the left cell backwash valve at a low flow setting, turn the black dial under the "Right Cell Backwash Valve" label to a low flow setting. (30 Seconds)
12. STEP 14: Turn the black dial under the "Left Cell Backwash Valve" label to the off setting, while turning the black dial under the "Right Cell Backwash Valve" label to a medium flow setting. (30 Seconds)
13. STEP 15: Turn the black dial under the "Right Cell Backwash Valve" label to a high flow setting, then push the green "Open Valve" button under the "Right Cell SAND-Wash Valve" label to turn on the right cell sand-wash arms. (120 Seconds)
	1. Leave the right cell backwash valve at the high flow setting, push the red "Close Valve" button under the "Right Cell Sand-Wash Valve" label to turn off the right cell sand-wash arms. (120 Seconds)
14. STEP 16: Turn the black dial under the "Right Cell Backwash Valve" label to a medium flow setting. (30 Seconds)
15. STEP 17: Turn the black dial under the "Right Cell Backwash Valve" label to a low flow setting. (30 Seconds)
	1. Push the red "Close Valve" button under the "Wash Water Pump" label to turn off the wash water pump. (10 Seconds)
16. STEP 18: Turn the black dial under the "Right Cell Back Wash Valve" label to turn off the setting and pause to drain the remaining wash water filter. (65 Seconds)
17. STEP 19: Push the red "Close Valve" button under the "Filter Drain Valve" label to close the drain. (10 Seconds)
18. STEP 20: Push the green "Open Valve" button under the "Settled Water Filter Influent Valve" label to open the settled water valve which will fill the filter. Do this step in multiple stages to fill the filter to the appropriate level.
	1. **Wait about 240 Seconds between each fill****
19. After the back wash process is finished, complete both the "Filter Worksheet" found on the google docs "Drive" page and the "Filter Operations" information found on the google docs.
