After talking to Jim Voigt today, there appears to be some errors/omissions by WE Energies on recent paperwork. As a check, please do the following before making a submission to the DNR website.

1.	Check the “Sample Type”
	1. If D-Routine Distribution, C-Check, R-Repeat
		1. There should be a chlorine residual listed in “Section III”
			1.	If there isn’t a chlorine residual listed, call Jim Voigt (or Mike Rau) and leave message describing the problem. Do not submit to DNR website.
			- If everything is okay submit as usual.
	- If N-New Construction, I-Investigation, or W- (Raw) Water
		1. There may or may not be a chlorine residual listed in “Section III”
			1. Submit as usual.

Again, NSWC is not making the mistakes. We are trying to help them catch any mistakes they are making.
