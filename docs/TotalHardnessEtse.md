### Introduction
Total hardness test is performed by titration of a known volume  of water using a standard titrant. A color indicator is used to visual indicate when the endpoint of the titration is complete. When the endpoint is reached, the titrant has quenched all of the calcium ion present in solution sufficiently for the determination of total hardness.

### Summary
This method requires employee to collect 100 g  of Tap water sample, add 1mL of  the appropriate hardness buffer using pipetter for it's accuracy.
***

### Materials & Equipment Needed
- Bench top scale
- Hardness buffer
- Eriochrome Black T. indicator
- Burette
- Flask
- Tap water
***

### Personal Safety
There are no personal safety concerns involved in this procedure.
***

### Operation Warnings
Total hardness test  will not affect any other work in the lab.
***

### Special Notes
None
***

### Procedure
1. Collect Tap water sample let it sit about 1 hour to match room temperature.
- With bench-top scale, weight 100g of that Tap water collected but first make sure you Zero the scale  before you use it.
- With your 1 mL pipetter, pipette 1 mL of hardness buffer and add it to the water that you weight previously.
- Add 1 to 2 squirt of dry Eriochrome Black T. indicator to that 100g of water sample
- Swirl till completely mix and notice purple color.
- Get your  burette fill up with EDTA reagent to the top mark (0 mL).
- Place your water flask under the burette and start titration turn burette stopcock to dispense reagent till you see color change from purple to blue then turn off burette stopcock.
- Record the amount (mL) of reagent use after the color change appear then multiply final number by 10 to get the Total hardness of the test.
