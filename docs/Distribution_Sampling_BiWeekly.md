###Introduction
The safety of drinking water supplied to the consumers by water treatment plant operators is dependent upon many factors: quality of raw water (surface water and/ or ground water), application of appropriate treatment technology/disinfection (as needed), and monitoring of treated/finished water within the water distribution system network. 

Appropriate treatment/disinfection technologies for both surface and ground water sources are identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in various regulations that were promulgated pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) of 1974 and its amendments. Although the treated water leaving a treatment plant typically meets EPAâ€™s water quality requirements, the water could undergo transformation within the various distribution system components (e.g., storage tanks and pipes), which alters the quality, potentially making it unsuitable for human consumption. 

To address these issues, EPA has developed specific regulations that mandate periodic monitoring of water quality within distribution systems. Distribution system sample collection is done according to Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 809 for safe drinking water. North Shore Water Commission (NSWC) requires 2 weekly sample from each of the Glendale, Whitefish Bay and Fox point distribution systems to be analyzed for Total Chlorine, Fluoride and turbidity.

###Operation Warnings
Ensure that samples are collected and analyzed according to current regulations, including the practice of proper aseptic techniques for bacterial sampling. You are a representative of the North Shore Water Commission when you are in the field collecting samples, ensure that your action reflect well.

###Personal Safety
Use common sense when acquiring samples.

###Materials, Supplies & Equipment
- 3 clean, approximately 250 ml collection vessels 
***

###Standard Operating Procedure

**Proceed to any representative location, one in each distribution system, two times a week**	

- Turn on Hot water tap and allow to run for 2 minutes, turn on cold water tap and allow to run for 3 minutes, collect sample
	- Standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater, 22nd edition, samples section 9060 subsection A, 9-33
	- Clean up area
	- Note the address/location of sampling site

**Procedure upon return to lab:**

- Analyze each sample:
	- Turbidity
	- Total Chlorine
	- Fluoride, probe
		- See SOP Routine Chemical analysis to complete sample analysis (SOP Routine Chemical Analysis.docx)
- Record results in the Distribution sample log for each respective community
	- Located in the lab next to incubator
***

###Special Notes
Samples must be collected twice a week, every week.
