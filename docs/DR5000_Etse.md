### Introduction
The HACH DR 5000 is the bench-top instrument used to measure UV reactive on water and also use  for free and total chlorine residuals. Plant staff has programmed the instrument to measure UV reactive and chlorine residual. But in this section i'am going to focus on calibration procedure and test of Tap water with this instrument.
***

### Summary
This method requires employee to get distilled water which is also known as reagent water, and Tap water.
***

### Materials & Equipment Needed
- DR5000 (instrument)
- 1 cm x 1 cm cuvette
- DI water( Reagent water )
- Tap water
- Lint-free wipe / tissue that does not scratch plastic
***

### Personal Safety
This procedure only use DI water for calibration.
***

### Operation Warnings
Calibrating  this instrument  will not affect any other process..
***

### Special Notes
None
***

### Procedure
This procedure assumes Hach DR5000 instrument is in good working order

1. Get reagent water which is consider as 100% clean water fill it up
- On the instrument's screen pres Single wavelength to turn on the light.
- Same time notice above the screen UV 254 this number is a sign that help you know that you are on the track.
- Now press Option and choose % TRANS to verify again you will see 254 from there press OK key.
- Now go ahead and place that cuvette in the instrument and press Zero key
- Wait about 60 seconds while it is programming when done DR5000  will display  100% on the screen. Calibration completed.
- Now you can go ahead and get Tap water that you are about to measure, place it in the instrument then press Read key.
- Finally record result.
