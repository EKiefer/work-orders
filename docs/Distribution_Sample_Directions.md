System sample collection is done according to Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 809.31, which specifies biological sampling. Total coliform testing is done on dates evenly spaced during the month. For N.S.W.C. that is about once every week. The number of samples taken is proportionate to the population served. NSWC serves about 35,000 people, which means NSWC must take 30 samples each month.
