## Energy Conservation

In an effort to reduce our electrical consumption, I would like for everybody to minimize electrical consumption whenever possible. There isn't a lot we can do and the effects may not seem that significant; however, over the course of a year, I'm hoping to see savings of at least $2K.

Here are the ways in which we can save energy:

1. Shut off unnecessary lights. Most areas of the plant should be illuminated for security purposes; however, instead of turning all of the lights in a room on, perhaps we can just turn on a single bank of lights.  
2. Turn off unnecessary fans and heaters.  
3. Use the air conditioner as needed.  

Here are some of the actions I took today:

1.	Turned off the dehumidifier by high service pumps.  
2.	Turned off filter wing fans.  
3.	Turned off unnecessary lights in the basement and in the chemical feed room.  

There are other ways to save electricity. If you think of any, please feel free to share them with everybody.
