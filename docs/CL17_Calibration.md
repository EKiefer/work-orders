### Introduction
In this SOP, i will be covering on how to calibrate the prominent chlorine analyzers. Here 2 total chlorine lab analysis will be taken to receive a value for re calibration.
***

### Summary
This method requires employee to collect a water sample, add the appropriate DPD-based chemical, and use the DR5000 to measure the chlorine residual. Along with using the Prominent analyzers for calibration.
***

### Materials & Equipment Needed
- DR5000 (instrument)
- 1 cm x 1 cm cuvette
- DPD Reagent (free OR total)
- Lint-free wipe / tissue that does not scratch plastic
- Prominent Chlorine Analyze
***

### Personal Safety
This procedure uses a product called DPD.
***

### Operation Warnings
Checking chlorine residual with this instrument will not affect any other process.
***

### Special Notes
None
***

### Procedure
This procedure assumes Hach DR5000 instrument is in good working order and the that method is set to  "954 CL".

1 .Use clean beaker to collect a sample of water.  For convenience, sample should be approximately 20 mL, but can be less.
2. If the instrument needs to be zero'ed, fill up clean cuvette to top with water from beaker, insert cuvette into instrument, and press the "zero" button.
3. Use pipettor(also referred to as a pipet) to draw 5 mL.
4. Dispose of remaining water in beaker (leave 5 mL in pipettor).
5. Dispense the water in pipettor to beaker.
6. Use the DPD reagent labelled for use with total chlorine residual for two samples.
7. Open packet of reagent with scissors or by tearing with fingers.
8. Dump reagent into beaker with water.
9. If you are doing a total chlorine analysis, swirl to mix--wait at least 1 minute but no more than 3 minutes. If everything is working correctly, the water should turn pink if there is chlorine in the sample.
10. After the appropriate amount of time has passed, pour sample into cuvette (remember to use an empty cuvette).
11. To ensure any residual water in cuvette does not dilute sample, pour sample from cuvette to beaker and then from beaker to cuvette.
12. Press the read button on the instrument.
13. Record the value shown on the screen.

Calibrating the Prominent Chlorine Analyzers

1. Do 2 Total chlorine lab tests to get a value for calibrating the prominent analyzer.
2. Hit SWITCH MODE until CALIBRATION? is displayed and then hit the ENTER button.
3. Hit the MODE button until CALIBRATION CI2 is displayed and hit ENTER.
4. ***Current value will be displayed*** use the UP and DOWN arrows to match the value from the lab test.
5. Hit ENTER twice and then hit the EXT to return to the main screen.
