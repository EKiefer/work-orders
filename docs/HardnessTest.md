### Introduction
Total hardness test is performed by titration of a known volume of water using a standard titrant. A color indicator is used to visually indicate when the endpoint of the titration is reached.
***

### Summary
This method requires 100 mL of tap water sample, and 1mL of  hardness buffer using pipette. Titrate until results are reached.
***

### Materials & Equipment Needed

- Bench top scale

- 250 mL round flask

- 1 mL pipetter

- Hardness buffer

- Hardness EDT (0.01 titrant)

- Eriochrome Black T. indicator

- Burette

- Tap water sample

### Procedure

1. Collect Tap water sample and let it sit until it reaches room temperature. Using the bench top scale, weigh out 100 mL of the sample. Place the flask onto the scale but be sure to have it zeroed first. Pour sample until you have reached 100g and you may also use a pipetter for more accuracy.  
<br />

- Pipette 1 mL of the hardness buffer into the weighed out water sample. Then you will add one squirt of the Eriochrome Black T. indicator and swirl until everything is completely mixed. You will notice the sample will have a pink tint to it.  
<br />

- Before titration can start, you must make sure that the burette is completely filled with EDT reagent up to the 0 mL mark on the top of the burette.  
<br />

- Place sample under the burette and carefully begin to titrate the EDT reagent. Turn the stopcock on the burette so only a slight drip is coming from it. Swirl sample as titration occurs to insure good enough mixing. You will know when you have reached the end results because the sample will change in color from a pink to a blue. Take a reading of how much reagent was used and multiply that number by ten. This will be your final total hardness reading. Record data.
