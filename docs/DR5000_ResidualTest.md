### Introduction
The HACH DR5000 is the benchtop instrument used to measure free and total chlorine residuals. Plant staff has programmed the instrument to measure chlorine residual using DPD and a 1 cm x 1 cm cuvette. Other methods are available, but this method will be discussed in this section.
***

### Summary
This method requires employee to collect a water samples from the filtered water, reservoir and also the tap. Add the appropriate DPD-based chemical, and use the DR5000 to measure the chlorine residual.

### Materials & Equipment Needed
DR5000 (instrument)
1 cm x 1 cm cuvette
DPD Reagent (free OR total)
Lint-free wipe / tissue that does not scratch plastic
***

### Personal Safety
This procedure uses a product called DPD.
***

### Operation Warnings
Checking chlorine residual with this instrument will not affect any other process.
***

### Special Notes
None

### Procedure
This procedure assumes Hach DR5000 instrument is in good working order and the that method is set to  "954 CL".

1. Use clean beaker to collect a sample of water.  For convenience, sample should be approximately 20 mL, but can be less.
2. If the instrument needs to be zero'ed, fill up clean cuvette to top with water from beaker, insert cuvette into instrument, and press the "zero" button.
3. Use pipettor(also referred to as a pipet) to draw 5 mL.
4. Dispose of remaining water in beaker (leave 5 mL in pipettor).
5. Dispense the water in pipettor to beaker.
6. If you are doing a free chlorine analysis, use the DPD reagent labelled for use with free chlorine.  Otherwise, use the DPD reagent labelled for use with total chlorine residual.
7. Open packet of reagent with scissors or by tearing with fingers.
8. Dump reagent into beaker with water.
9. If you are doing a free chlorine analysis, swirl to mix and wait no more than 1 minute. If you are doing a total chlorine analysis, swirl to mix--wait at least 1 minute but no more than 3 minutes. If everything is working correctly, the water should turn pink if there is chlorine in the sample.
10. After the appropriate amount of time has passed, pour sample into cuvette (remember to use an empty cuvette).
11. To ensure any residual water in cuvette does not dilute sample, pour sample from cuvette to beaker and then from beaker to cuvette.
12. Press the read button on the instrument.
13. Record the value shown on the screen.
