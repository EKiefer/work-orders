### Introduction
The 1720 E Online turbidimeter  measures the amount or turbidity that is coming through. When talking about turbidity, we are talking the amount of cloudiness or discoloration in the water. This meter, like all meters needs to be properly clean and calibrated every 3 months to ensure a proper reading for the plant.
***

### Summary
This method requires an employee/ operator to Clean the meter using chlorine to remove any algae that has built up in the last 3 months and also calibrate it using a bottle of  20 NTU StablCal, Distilled water and also the control panel.

### Materials & Equipment Needed
- SCADA System
- Control Panel
- 1720 E turbidimeter
- 20 NTU Reagent
- Distilled water
- 2 Calibration cylinders
- Soap
- Thistled Brush
- Chlorine (Kills Algae)
***

### Personal Safety
This procedure uses a product called StablCal standard reagent along with Chlorine for disinfecting the inside of the Housing unit.
***

### Operation Warnings
Calibrating this  instrument will not affect any other process.
***

### Special Notes
**Before any process starts make sure the meter is controlled inhibited.

**Keep cylinders covered when not in use to prevent contamination of the reagents
***

### Procedure
**Before Starting the Cleaning and Calibration process, go up to the SCADA system and control inhibit the meter you are using. Control inhibiting haults the reading so that it can be properly clean and calibrated.**

1. Remove the sensor head from the housing unit and spray off the sensor with the distilled water. Gently Dab it off.
2. Place the sensor head into the Distilled water cylinder and making sure that it is placed on correctly.
3. Clean out the housing unit with chlorine, soap and water, and a thistled brush.
- The use of chlorine in the cleaning process removes and kills any algae that has formed or built up since the last cleaning and calibration process.
4. Remove the plug from the bottom of the housing unit to drain the contaminated water. Rinse the Inside of the housing unit with the distilled water to remove any excess residue from cleaning the inside.
5. Place the plug back onto the bottom of the housing unit.
6. Transfer the sensor head from the Distilled water cylinder to the 20 NTU cylinder. Making sure that it is placed on correctly. Tap the side of the cylinder to remove any bubbles.
7. On the control panel hit MENU
- Sensor Setup and hit ENTER
- Calibration and hit ENTER
- StablCal and hit ENTER
- Active and hit ENTER
- ENTER to Continue
- ENTER to Accept
- GOOD CAL! hit ENTER to continue
8. Once the calibration is finished, take the sensor head from the 20 NTU and rinse and dab it off and then place it back properly onto the housing unit. Cover both cylinders now that they are done being used.
