### Introduction
1720 D low range turbidimeter measures the amount or turbidity that is coming through. When talking about turbidity, we are talking the amount of cloudiness or discoloration in the water. This meter, like all meters needs to be properly cleaned and calibrated often to ensure a proper reading.
***

### Summary
This method requires an employee/ operator to Clean the meter using chlorine to remove any algae that has built up since last calibration and also calibrate it using a bottle of  20 NTU StablCal, Distilled water and also the control panel.
***

### Materials & Equipment Needed
- SCADA System
- Main Control Hub
- 1720 D/L low range turbidimeter (instrument)
- 20 NTU Reagent
- 2 Calibration cylinders
- Soap
- Chlorine (Kills Algae)
- Thistled Brush
- Distilled water
***

### Personal Safety
This procedure uses a product called StablCal standard reagent along with chlorine for disinfection of the housing unit
***

### Operation Warnings
Calibrating this  instrument will not affect any other process.
***

### Special Notes
Before any cleaning or calibration processes, the meter needs to be controlled inhibited to properly clean and calibrate the meter.
***

### Procedure
** Before any process starts, go on the SCADA system and find meter the filter meter you are calibrating and control inhibit it to hault its reading so that way we can properly clean and calibrate it.**

1. Remove the sensor head from the housing unit and rinse off the sensor with the distilled water and then gently dab it off.
2. Place the sensor head into the distilled water. Making sure that it is placed on correctly.
3. Clean the inside of the housing unit with chlorine to disinfect and remove any algae that may have built up since last cleaning and calibration.
4. Take soapy water and a brush and continue to clean it.
5. Once cleaned remove the plug at the bottom of the housing unit to drain the water.
6. Rinse out the housing unit with the distilled water to remove any excess residue from cleaning the housing unit.
7. Place the plug back into the bottom of the housing unit.
8. Transfer the the sensor head from the distilled water to the 20 NTU reagent . Making sure that the sensor head is placed on correctly. Tap the side of the cylinder to remove any bubbles that may have formed.
9. In order to calibrate the specific filter meter, you are going to use the central meter hub.
a. Select the meter and hit ENTER
b. Select Calibration and hit ENTER
c. Select StablCal and hit ENTER
d. Stand value of 20 and hit ENTER
e. Hit ENTER to continue
f. Accept Reading
g. Accept calibration
h. Enter your initials and hit ENTER
i. Finally hit the EXIT button until the main screen is shown.
10. Remove the sensor head from the 20 NTU solution
11. Rinse the sensor off and dab it once more
12. Place sensor head back onto the housing unit.
