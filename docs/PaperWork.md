###Standard Operating Procedure
- Complete after 00:15 to ensure SCADA system has time to update all data
- Start on chemical side of paper daily operator record and fill in all blanks at the bottom
	- Chlorine and Turbidity AVE, MAX and MIN are calculated for the day (do not include the first 23:00 reading), numbers can be found at the bottom of the computer daily operator record 
	- TOT: Number for individual chemicals is the total of that chemical used for the day (subtract the present 23:00 reading from the previous 23:00 reading)
		- Take into account if a tank was filled during that time period and calculate accordingly
		- For Fluoride (Fl) use the scale number and multiply it by 0.24 to get active pounds
	- Fill in MAX and MIN for remaining columns
	- Bulk Chemical inventory on the bottom of the sheet
		- Obtain Alum, FL and Hypo CPU# on SCADA (chemicals tab, chemical storage
		- Inches are found in the basement on the sight tubes for Fluoride and Alum storage tanks, Hypo is not recorded
		- ACT# for Alum and Fluoride is calculated by entering inches on the bottom of the computer daily operator record under chemical measurement conversions (bulk tanks), Hypo is not recorded
- Pumping side of paper daily operator record
	- MAX and MIN numbers
		- Find the max and min for the day not including the prior 23:00 readings
	- Flow totals
		- TOTAL H.S., COMM TOT and 3 community totals are found on SCADA under the Trends tab, high service screen.
		- Wash is found under the Filters tab, Filter control, at the top of the page backwash flow rate, yesterdays flow
		- Individual filter totals are under the Filters tab, set points, yesterday’s flow (MG)
	- CHEM PPM/ ACT#
		- Values are calculated by entering the required numbers on the computer daily operator record on the far right side in the CHEM PPM/ ACT# worksheet
			- PLMR is a combination of Klode and Bender polymers
			- CL:NH3 record the number and in (parentheses) record the alt calculation next to it
	- MAX FLOW
		- On the SCADA overview run point parameters on COMM. TOTAL MGD, trend 24 hour and find and record the max flow and time it occurred
	- CHEM ANALYSIS
		- Filled in by C shift operator
	- KHW METER
		- Located in the motor room on the west wall under the stairs
			- S is on the left and N is on the right
	- Sludge (TOT. FLOW)
		- Filled in by shift operators
	- RES. LEVEL
		- Record the present reservoir level located on the SCADA overview page and calculate the change from the previous level
		- MG DIFF is not recorded
- Start a new paper daily operator record sheet
	- Located in the second drawer on the right side of the operator desk
	- Transfer the ending 23:00 numbers to the starting 23:00 row
	- Transfer present Res level and KHW meter numbers to previous spots on new sheet
	- Enter day and date on the top of both sides of the sheet
- Computer daily operator record
	- Enter the previous and present KWH meter readings
	- Save the sheet
	- Open new sheet , desk top folder “DailySheetsA”, Blank_2013-09-22
		- Save sheet as DS(2 digit year)(2 digit month)(2 digit day) EX. DS131225 for 2013 December 25
		- Enter data from current sheet 23:00 slot into top of new sheet
		- Enter date information on top of sheet
	- Close the old sheet
	- Enter data from paper Daily Operator Record onto the Daily Data Form on google drive
		- Distribution sample address is located in the Glendale distribution sample log in the lab
		- Bulk tank readings (columns AQ-AX) are found on SCADA, Chemicals tab, chemical storage
	- Enter data into Filter worksheet on google drive
		- Select each filter’s tab on the bottom and enter data 
			- Run hours and Max head loss are found on SCADA under the filters tab, Filter control
			- Max Turbidity is found on SCADA under the filters tab, Turbidity
	- Select each filter and run point parameter, 24 hour trend and find the max
		- Backwashed filters should already be completed
- Place previous paper daily operator record sheet in the front lobby on the stack on the desk
