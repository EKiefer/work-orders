We have a new brand of spore suspensions. Please note that the new brand, Prospore2, is different from BT Sure as listed below:

1. Prospore2 only needs to be incubated for 24 hours instead of 48 hours.
2. The ampoule is slightly bigger than BT Sure, so 2 holes were drilled out on the incubator to allow for the new ampoules to fit in the hole.
3. A total of 2 ampoules need to be used per autoclave event.
	- Step 1: one ampoule goes into the autoclave and the other stays out of the autoclave.
	- Step 2: after the autoclave cycle is over, both ampoules are “activated.” There is a black plastic device that first seals the plastic tube and then crushes the glass ampoule inside. (See picture below)
	- Step 3: both “activated” ampoules go in the BT Sure dry incubator (aluminum block). 
	-Step 4: after incubation (24 hours) compare the colors and confirm that the ampoule that was autoclaved is still clear and purple.
