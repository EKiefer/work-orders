I worked out billing so that we can get gasoline and diesel from Fox Point. Below is the protocol one must follow to get fuel from Fox Point. Please keep in mind that this is only for NSWC-related use.

1. Drive to pump 1 for gasoline or pump 2 for diesel (by Fox Point DPW).
- Type in the following information at the pump:
	- Enter vehicle #: 1400 for gasoline, 0402 for diesel
	- Enter PIN#: 
		- Eric Kiefer, #50400
		- Duane Ziege, #50401
		- Mark Peters, #50407
		- Bryan Wolf, #
		- Dan Cherny, #
		- Brooks Angel, #
	- Enter mileage: input odometer reading.
	- Enter pump #1 for gasoline or pump #2 for diesel
- Reset counter by turning dial clockwise until you get all zeros.
- Pump gasoline or diesel as needed.
