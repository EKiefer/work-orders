## Chemical Transfer Procedure

### Introduction
The ultrasonic level indicators on all of our chemical feed tanks require calibration, repair, or replacement. We are in the process of acquiring new level indicators for the bulk tanks in the basement, and we just recalibrated the polyphosphate tank. We have a long road ahead of us in fixing these numbers—possibly taking until the end of summer before completion of this project.

### Manual Measurement
To find out what the “real” numbers are, we need to take manual measurements of the tank levels and then manually calculate the pounds of chemical. There are 2 instances where taking measurements are very important.

***Daily Sheet***- 
The DNR wants to know how much chemical we feed every day. Currently, we record information every round. Until further notice we will record the sight tube level (and calculated pounds) in addition to the computer reading. This way we can compare the two measurements, assuming the manual measurement is more accurate.

***Chemical Transfer***- 
When there is a chemical transfer, we need to record the levels before and after a transfer. Automatic transfers are going to be disabled so that you can record the levels accurately.

### Procedure
The daily sheet has been modified to provide a convenient place for you to record all of this new information. Additional worksheets are also available for help in making computations.

#### Daily Round Sheet
Every round, all the chemicals (except KMnO4) need to be recorded in the following way:

1.	At the time of your round, record active chemical pounds from the computer screen to the daily sheet. Record as CPU #.
2.	When doing the inspection of the plant, record the inches of chemical in each day chemical tank. Record as INCHES.
3.	At the end of the round, do the calculation to convert to active pounds of chemicals. See worksheet for help in making computation. Record as ACT #.

The following information also must be recorded during the last round of the day.

*At the time of the last round, do round as described above with the following additions:

1.	Record BULK active chemical pounds from the computer screen to the daily sheet. Record as CPU # (bottom of the sheet, upper row).
2.	When doing the inspection of the plant, record the inches of chemical in each BULK tank. Record as INCHES (bottom of the sheet, upper row).
3.	At the end of the round, do the calculation to convert to active pounds of chemicals. See worksheet for help in making computation. Record as ACT # (bottom of the sheet, upper row).

#### Chemical Transfers
In order to accurate measure before and after a fill, the automatic transfer of chemicals will be disabled. There will only be two ways for you to know when to transfer chemicals.

1.	The low level alarm will sound.
2.	On your round, you may notice the day tank level is low.

When you notice you need to transfer chemical, proceed with the following procedure.

1. Record the DAY tank active chemical pounds from the computer screen to the daily sheet. Record as CPU # (bottom of the sheet, middle row).
2. Measure the inches of chemical in the DAY tank. Record as INCHES (bottom of the sheet, middle row).
3. Start filling the tank using the local controls.
	- Hypochlorite controls for transfer pump 1 and 2 are located on RTU 8 panel. It doesn’t matter which one you use. However, when you fill the hypochlorite tank, remember the following special instructions:  <br />
		- During a transfer, run the polyphosphate injector pump (Auto/Off/Hand) by selecting Hand. Start and stop this pump when you start and stop the hypochlorite transfer pump.
		- Look to see which tank the transfer pump is going to pump to. To switch from the settled tank to the clearwell tank, you need to check the valves—under NORMAL circumstances, everything will be valved to fill the settled tank.
	- The fluoride transfer pump is controlled by the switch on RTU 8 panel. Switch to Hand to initiate filling.
	- The alum transfer pump controls are located right next to the alum day tanks. Press start to initiate filling. Note: transfer pump 2 is known to be in good working condition—transfer pump 1 may not work properly.
4.	Visually inspect filling. Stop filling the tank when it is near the normal fill stop level.
	- Hypochlorite controls should be turned to Off.
	- Fluoride controls should be turned to Off.
	- The alum stop button needs to be pushed. 
5.	Record the DAY tank active chemical pounds from the computer screen to the daily sheet. Record as CPU # (bottom of the sheet, lower row).
6.	Measure the inches of chemical in the DAY tank. Record as INCHES (bottom of the sheet, lower row).
7.	At the end of the transfer, do the calculation to convert to active pounds of chemicals. See worksheet for help in making computation. Record as ACT # (bottom of the sheet, lower row).

#### Worksheets
Worksheets are provided for your convenience. I’ve printed them out and placed them into a binder for you to use. If you are close to running out of sheets, please make copies before using the last one.

*NOTE: A separate work sheet should be used for every calculation and saved in the binder until you are confident enough to do the calculation without assistance. You can do the calculation without writing out a separate worksheet—they are there for your assistance.
