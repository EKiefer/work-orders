### Introduction
This test helps determine the amount of phosphate in drinking water. The DNR requires that water treatment plants frequently monitors their water for phosphorous, heavy metals,bacteria, chemicals, and other organics.
***

### Summary
This procedure requires the collection of a 2 mL tap water sample mixed with the phosphorous reagent in a small glass tube which is allowed to sit and be tested.

### Materials & Equipment Needed
- HACH DR5000 (instrument)

- Phosphorous kit

- Dosi cap

- 2 Pipettes ( 0.2mL and 1.0mL )

- Phosphorous reagent

- Tube holder
***

### Personal Safety
This procedure uses a phosphorous reagent which should not be spilled on your skin.
***

### Operation Warnings
Checking  phosphorous  with the HACH DR5000 will not affect any other process.

### Special Notes
There are no special notes for this test.

### Procedure
1. Gather all of your materials and equipment you are going to need. Once you open your phosphorous kit, you will get out one of the testing tubes which contains a reagent. You will discard the green factory cap and in doing this be sure not to spill any of the liquid reagent in the tube.  
<br />

2. The next step will be to pipette 2 mL of your tap water sample into the testing tube using the 1 mL pipette twice. Then you will open up the tiny container of phosphorous reagent and pipette 0.2mL, placing that into the testing tube.  
<br />

3. There will be another small container in the phosphorous kit that contains dosi caps. On the inside of these caps there is a power reagent that is used in this test. Place one of the caps on the testing tube and be sure that it is secure. Invert the testing tube at least 20 times to insure that all of the powder reagent mixes in well with the sample solution. For extra assurance that it is mixed well shake on the vortex for a few seconds.  
<br />

4. Let the testing tube sit for 10 minutes while the chemical reaction happens. Once 10 minutes is up you will notice a light hint of blue in the testing tube solution. Now on the HACH DR5000 you will exit onto the main menu screen. On the testing tube there is a bar code that is read once placed into the DR5000 facing forward. The results will appear on the screen, then record your data.
