### Introduction
Hourly rounds are performed every 2-4 hours. This task is done to ensure that the plant is running effectively and nothing is going wrong at the time. Values from the SCADA system are recorded on the daily round sheet so that they can be compared to past results. Measurements from the chemical day tanks are recorded, inspection of pumps, meters, chemical analysis.
***

### Summary

This method requires an operator to record values from the SCADA system, inspect the operation of the plant, record data, and perform chemical analysis.

### Personal Safety

None
***
 
### Operator Safety
- Be sure to know the correct ranges for the chemicals added to the water.

- Watch for tripping/slipping hazards

- Weird/out of the norm noises with mechanical equipment

- More than usual water leaking

- High/Low chemical levels
***

###Special Notes

- Notify plant manager or operator on call of any SCADA emergencies with the plant.

- Also notify the next Operator that comes in about what has happened or changed recently.

### Procedure

#### Rounds Part 1:

- Fill out the daily/hourly round sheet using the SCADA system
- Begin walk through by recording the values from the daily chemical tanks onto the round sheet.
- Check tanks, pumps, etc to make sure nothing is leaking or needs to be filled.
- Record the outside temperature
- Walk down to the lower level and check the ammonia chiller temp (Around 40.0 degrees)
- Walk around the first chemical bulk tanks to make sure nothing is leaking.
- Hit the first operators check point and walk down through the side wing to make sure that everything isrunning properly. Once every shift check the sludge count and record it.
- Make sure to listen for weird out of the norm sounds, loud bangs, excessive water or leaking.
- Check the second set of bulk tanks for fluoride and Alum, to make sure nothing is leaking or strong odor.
- If you are doing the last round on the data sheet record the values from the fluoride and alum tanks.
-Do a quick walk through of the boiler room to make sure everything is running effectively.
go down to the lowest level and check to make sure the meters are running properly and the values are within range.
- Check the filter pumps to make sure there is no excessive leaking than usual
- Check the second operator check point up by the UV.
- Check all UV pumps to make sure everything is running properly and also check the UV panel to  make sure the % Trans matches up with the lower panel, (Can be .1 or .2 off).
- Check high speed pumps for excessive leaking and loud noises.
- Check Turbidity Meters
- Go up stairs to the main level to the motor room and record the value of the high speed lead amps. Check to make sure that the motors are not over heating, on fire, etc.
- Check the third and final operators check point.


#### Rounds Part 2:

- Do chlorine Residual testing.
- Free chlorine for the filtered and reservoir water.
- Total Chlorine for tap water
- Record values on the data sheet
- Do Turbidity analysis on:
	1. Raw
 	2. Settled
    3. Filtered
    4. Tap

- Odor test of either Raw on Tap
(do every other each round)
- Write down the pH values from the 3 meters
