### Introduction
When calibrating the Swan Chlorine Analyzer, the DR5000 will be used to get the total chlorine test using the water with the  Post-Ammonia. That value is entered in for the calibration of the analyzer.
***

### Summary
This method requires employee to collect a water sample, add the appropriate DPD-based chemical, and use the DR5000 to measure the chlorine residual, along with using the Swan Analyzer for calibration.
***

### Materials & Equipment Needed
- DR5000 (instrument)
- 1 cm x 1 cm cuvette
- DPD Reagent (free OR total)
- Lint-free wipe / tissue that does not scratch plastic
- Chlorine Swan Analyzer
***

### Personal Safety
This procedure uses a product called DPD.
***

### Operation Warnings
Checking chlorine residual with this instrument will not affect any other process.
***

### Special Notes
None

### Procedure
This procedure assumes Hach DR5000 instrument is in good working order and the that method is set to  "954 CL".

1. Use clean beaker to collect a sample of water.  For convenience, sample should be approximately 20 mL, but can be less.
- If the instrument needs to be zero'ed, fill up clean cuvette to top with water from beaker, insert cuvette into instrument, and press the "zero" button.
- Use pipettor(also referred to as a pipet) to draw 5 mL.
- Dispose of remaining water in beaker (leave 5 mL in pipettor).
- Dispense the water in pipettor to beaker.
- Use the DPD reagent labelled for use with total chlorine residual.
- Open packet of reagent with scissors or by tearing with fingers.
- Dump reagent into beaker with water.
- Total chlorine analysis, swirl to mix--wait at least 1 minute but no more than 3 minutes. If everything is working correctly, the water should turn pink if there is chlorine in the sample.
- After the appropriate amount of time has passed, pour sample into cuvette (remember to use an empty cuvette).
- To ensure any residual water in cuvette does not dilute sample, pour sample from cuvette to beaker and then from beaker to cuvette.
- Press the read button on the instrument.
- Record the value shown on the screen.


Calibrating the Chlorine Swan Analyzer

1. Hit ENTER and then hit the DOWN arrow until MAINTENANCE is highlighted, and hit ENTER again.
2. Hit ENTER to select CALIBRATION
3. Hit the DOWN arrow until TOTAL CHLORINE is highlighted
4. Hit ENTER to change the process value

	1. ***The current value will be highlighted with a box***
	2. Use the UP and DOWN arrows to change the value that was received from the Total Chlorine test.

5. Hit ENTER to leave the adjustment process, hit ENTER again to save.
6. Once CALIBRATION SUCCESSFUL is displayed, hit the EXT  button until main screen is displayed.
