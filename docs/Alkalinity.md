### Introduction

Total Alkalinity is a test performed by titration of a known volume of water using a standard titrant. A color indicator is used to visually indicate when the endpoint of the titration has successfully been completed.

### Summary

This procedure calls for the collection of  100 mL of Tap/Raw water sample. Add Bromocresol green methyl red indicator and begin titrating until color changes.

### Materials & Equipment Needed

- Bench top scale
- Daily records sheet
- Bromocresol green methyl red indicator
- Burette
- 0.02N Sulfuric Acid
- Round Flask
- Raw/Tap water sample

### Special Notes

Obtain raw & tap samples for daily chemical analysis at least an hour before using to allow samples to reach room temperature.

### Procedure

1. Measure out 100 mL of the sample into a 250 mL round flask using the bench top scale. In order to measure out you will place the round flask onto the bench top scale and zero it out. Then take your sample and pour into the flask until you get right around 100 g. To be more accurate you may pipette the small amount of water you may need into or out of the round flask. Remember to have let the sample warm to room temperature.

- The next step would be to add around 12 drops of  Bromocresol green methyl red indicator to the 100 mL of sample in your round flask. Mix the color indicator and sample by swirling until the sample color is a vivid blue color.

- Place the round flask filled with the colored sample under the burette filled with 0.02 N sulfuric acid. Be sure the burrette is filled completely to the 0mL line.

- Once you are ready to being titrating, carefully and slowly turn the handle on the burette to dispense the sulfuric acid reagent into the sample while swirling the flask at the same time. Be sure to only allow the reagent to drip out slowly while titrating.

- The color will change from a blue to a lighter red. Results should end near 13 mL but for recording purposes that data is multiplied by 10. Perform this procedure and record this data for both Raw and Tap water samples.
