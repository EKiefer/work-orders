### Introduction

The fluoride analysis is a test performed to monitor the amount of fluoride in water. Fluoride is added to water to prevent the formation of tooth decay. This test needs to be monitored closely and daily.
***

### Summary

This method requires an operator to collect a tap water sample from the sample flow on  the fluoride meter that is located down on the lowest level of the plant. This method also uses 1ppm and 10ppm for calibration and also the TISAB II that is added for analysis.
***

### Materials & Equipment Needed

- Fluoride ISE probe (Ion Selective Electrode)
- Tap water from the fluoride sample flow
- TISAB II
- 3 small plastic beakers
- Stir sticks
- 1 ppm and 10 ppm reagent use to calibrate the meter
- Pipette ( 5 mL )
***

### Personal Safety

This procedure uses different reagents for calibrating and also for analysis
***

### Operation Warnings

Checking the fluoride with this instrument will not effect any other processes
***

### Special Notes

These samples are done daily at the plant and also for distribution samples.
***

### Procedure

1. Go down to the lowest level of the plant and take a sample from the sample flow on the fluoride meter. Rinse sample container once with the sample water and then take a sample.
2. Write down or take note of the reading that is shown on the meter for analysis.

#### CALIBRATION

1. Connect the fluoride extension to the back of the pH meter to properly perform analysis.
- Turn on the meter and hit the up arrow until ISE/mgL is displayed.
- Hit the calibrate button and ISE CAL will show up.
- Remove the white bottle from the fluoride probe and rinse off the probe with the reagent water.
- In a small beaker place a stir stick and also the 1ppm reagent.
- Place the beaker on the mixing base and turn it on so the stir stick is moving.
- Then place the fluoride probe into the beaker to get a reading for the first reagent.
- The reading from the first reagent should be around 1.0. If the reading is not at 1.0, hit the numerical button and the up and down arrows to change the number shown to 1.00.
- Once the number has been changed, hit the calibrate button to change to the second calibration.
- Remove beaker and clean off the fluoride probe with the reagent water.
- In another small plastic beaker with a stir stick use the 10ppm and place the probe into the beaker to receive a reading.
- If the result is not around 10, change it using the numerical value button and the up and down arrows. Then hit the save button.
- Before taking the fluoride sample, rinse off the probe with the reagent water.
- In a small plastic beaker with a stir stick add 5mL of the tap sample and 5mL of the TISAB II.
- Place probe into the beaker and wait for a reading to come up.
- The result should be around the value you took off the fluoride meter.
