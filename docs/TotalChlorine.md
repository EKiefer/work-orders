### Introduction
For the strom water analysis  of Total chlorine the HACH DR5000 is used, which is a benchtop instrument used to measure free and total chlorine residuals. Plant staff has programmed the instrument to measure chlorine residual using DPD and a 1 cm x 1 cm cuvette. Other methods are available, but this method will be discussed in this section.

***

### Summary
This method requires employee to collect a storm water sample, add the appropriate DPD-based chemical, and use the DR5000 to measure the chlorine residual in the storm water
***

### Materials & Equipment Needed
- DR5000 (instrument)
- 1 cm x 1 cm cuvette
- DPD Reagent (free OR total)
- Lint-free wipe / tissue that does not scratch plastic
- Storm Analysis Record Book
***

### Personal Safety
This procedure uses a product called DPD.
***

### Operation Warnings
Checking chlorine residual with this instrument will not affect any other process.
***

### Special Notes
None 
***

### Procedure
1. Use clean beaker to collect a sample of the storm water.
- If the instrument needs to be zero'ed, fill up clean cuvette to top with water from beaker, insert cuvette into instrument, and press the "zero" button.
- Use pipet to draw 5 mL of the storm water sample.
- Dispose of remaining water in beaker.
- Dispense the water in pipet to beaker.
- Use the DPD reagent labelled for use with total chlorine residual.
- Open packet of reagent with scissors or by tearing with fingers.
- Dump reagent into beaker with water.
- Total chlorine analysis, swirl to mix--wait at least 1 minute but no more than 3 minutes. If everything is working correctly, the water should turn pink if there is chlorine in the sample.
- After the appropriate amount of time has passed, pour sample into cuvette
- Pour sample from cuvette to beaker and then from beaker to cuvette a few times.
- Fill cuvette up or over the line
- Wipe off any excess water or moisture on the outside and place in the DR5000
- Press the read button on the instrument.
- Record the value shown on the screen in the storm water analysis record book
