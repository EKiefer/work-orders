### Introduction
Total Alkalinity test is performed by titration of a known volume  of water using a standard titrant. A color indicator is used to visual indicate when the endpoint of the titration is complete. When the endpoint is reached, the titrant has neutralized the analyte appropriately for total alkalinity determination.

### Summary
This method requires employee to collect 100 g  of Tap/Raw water sample, add 3 to 5 drops of Bromocresol green methyl red indicator.
***

### Materials & Equipment Needed
- Bench top scale
- Bromocresol green methyl red indicator
- Burette
- Flask
- Tap/Raw water
***

### Personal Safety
There are no personal safety concerns involved in this procedure.
***

### Operation Warnings
Testing for total alkalinity would not affect any other lab works.
***

### Special Notes
None 
***

### Procedure
1. Collect Tap/Raw water sample let it sit about 1 hour to match room temperature.
- With bench-top scale, weight 100 g of that Tap/Raw water collected but first make sure you Zero the scale  before you use it.
- Add 3 to 5 drops of Bromocresol green methyl red indicator in that type of water that you weight previously.
- Swirl till completely mix and notice blue color to start with.
- Fill up burette with sulfuric acid reagent to the top mark (0 mL).
- While swirling sample with one hand, operate burette stopcock to dispense reagent with the other hand.
- When color change is noted, record the amount  (mL) of reagent used
- Total Alkalinity = ml of reagent used multiply by 10.
