###Introduction
The safety of drinking water supplied to the consumers by water treatment plant operators is dependent upon many factors: quality of raw water (surface water and/ or ground water), application of appropriate treatment technology/disinfection (as needed), and monitoring of treated/finished water within the water distribution system network. 

Appropriate treatment/disinfection technologies for both surface and ground water sources are identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in various regulations that were promulgated pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) of 1974 and its amendments. Although the treated water leaving a treatment plant typically meets EPAâ€™s water quality requirements, the water could undergo transformation within the various distribution system components (e.g., storage tanks and pipes), which alters the quality, potentially making it unsuitable for human consumption. 

To address these issues, EPA has developed specific regulations that mandate periodic monitoring of water quality within distribution systems.
Distribution system sample collection is done according to Wisconsin Administrative Code NR 809 for safe drinking water. North Shore Water Commission (NSWC) requires one daily sample from the Glendale distribution system to be analyzed for Total Chlorine, Fluoride and turbidity.

###Operation Warnings
Ensure that samples are collected and analyzed according to current regulations, including the practice of proper aseptic techniques for bacterial sampling. You are a representative of the North Shore Water Commission when you are in the field collecting samples, ensure that your action reflect well.

###Personal Safety
Use common sense when acquiring samples.

###Materials, Supplies & Equipment
- 1 clean 250 ml or larger collection vessel 
***

###Standard Operating Procedure

**Proceed daily to any representative location in Glendale distribution system**

- Turn on Hot water tap and allow to run for 2 minutes, turn on cold water tap and allow to run for 3 minutes, collect sample
	- Standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater, 22nd edition, samples section 9060 subsection A, 9-33
- Clean up sample area
- Note the address/location of sampling site

**Procedure upon return to lab:**

- Analyze each samples:
	- Turbidity
	- Total Chlorine
	- Fluoride by probe
		- In addition analyze the lab tap water for Fluoride, record results on the paper daily operator record under CHEM ANALYSIS, FL(LAB), TAP and denote it with a P for probe sample
		- See SOP [Routine Chemical Analysis](Chem_Analysis.md) for procedures on analyzing samples
- Record Glendale results in the Distribution sample log
	- Located in the lab next to incubator
- Record results on the daily operator record under CHEM ANALYSIS, DIST
***

###Special Notes
Sample must be acquired daily.
