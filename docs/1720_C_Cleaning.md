### Introduction
Turdimeter 1720C is online instrument used to measure turbidity. Turbidity is a measure of cloudiness of water and this instrument will also help the operator on duty to compare results collected  with bench top turbidimeter.
***

### Summary
This method requires the operator to properly clean and calibrate the online turbidimeter by using chlorine, soap, distilled water and a thistled brush for cleaning. Also, use distilled water and the 20 NTU for calibration.

### Procedure
<u>**Cleaning**</u>

1. Remove the housing unit head and clean off the sensor using distilled water (DI Water). Then gently dab it off with a lint-free cloth.
- Place the sensor head into the container containing the DI water.
- Spray the inside of the housing unit with chlorine.
***This removes/kills any algae that has formed and built up since the last cleaning and calibration.***
- Add soap and use a thistled brush to scub the inside of the housing unit.
- Pull the plug at the bottom of the housing unit to drain out the water.
- Once the water is drained out, rinse the housing unit with the DI water and place the plug back at the bottom of the housing unit.

<u>**Calibration**</u>

1. Hit SYSTEM RESET and then hit 6 and then SIG AVG.
- Type in 0.0 and then STD
- Transfer the sensor head to the 20 NTU reagent.
***Allow 2 to 3 minutes for the reading to stabilize.***
- Then enter 20.0 STD
- Replace the sensor head back onto the housing unit.
- CLEANING AND CALIBRATION COMPLETED!!!!!
