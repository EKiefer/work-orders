### Introduction
There are dozens of types of waterborne pathogens which can be spread in drinking water. The goal of the water treatment plant operator is to ensure that none of these pathogens are present in the finished water to infect the customers. However, testing the water for the presence of each type of waterborne pathogen is too time consuming and expensive to be feasible. Instead, operators test for the presence of one or a few indicator microorganisms which are usually present when pathogens are present.

The most commonly used indicator microorganisms are coliform bacteria, Coliform bacteria live in soils, on vegetation, in surface water and they are universally present in large numbers in the feces of warm-blooded animals (E. coli).  While coliforms themselves do not normally cause serious illness, they are easy to culture and their presence is used to indicate that other pathogenic organisms of fecal origin may be present. Such pathogens include bacteria, viruses, or protozoa and many multicellular parasites. Thus, the presence of coliform bacteria provide evidence that water has been polluted with sewage, and also indicates the possible presence of pathogenic microbes.

####Colilert Analysis

<u>Sample preparation</u>

- Obtain 100 ml sample in sterile Idexx bottle, Lab cabinet 3
	- Follow standardized methods for sample collection, allow hot water if present to run for 2 minutes followed by cold water for 3 minutes before collecting sample (Standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater, 22nd edition sect 9060 samples, subsection A collection)
	- Label cap with sample identification, shift, date, time and preparers initials
	- Idexx bottle contains Sodium Thiosulfate to quench residual chlorine 
- Add one sterile premeasured packet of Colilert, lab drawer 2, to sample
	- Shake until all contents of the packet are dissolved
	- If sample exhibits immediate color change discard sample and acquire a new sample in fresh sterile bottle
- Place sample in incubator for 24 hour incubation

### Special Notes

**Table 1: Comparator Chart**

|Appearance|Result|
|----------|------|
|Less yellow than comparator*|Negative for total coliforms and E. coli Record A (absent) for Total Coliform and A (absent) for E. coli|
|Yellow equal to or greater than the comparator|Positive for total coliforms, Record P (present) for Total Coliform; If sample does not fluoresce (blue) under UV lamp, record A (absent) E. coli|
|Yellow and fluorescence (blue) equal to or greater than the comparator|Positive for total coliforms and E. coli, Record P (present) for Total Coliform and P (present) for E. coli.|

 ***Note**: If the sample is slightly less yellow than comparator after 24 hours, it must be incubated for an additional 4 hours (a total of 28 hours). If the color is still lighter than the reference comparator at 28 hours, the sample is considered to be A (absent).!!!
