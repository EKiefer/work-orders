In order to measure out you will place the round flask onto the bench top scale and zero it out. Then take your sample and pour into the flask until you get right around 100 g. To be more accurate you may pipette the small amount of water you may need into or out of the round flask. Remember to have let the sample warm to room temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next step would be to add around 12 drops of  Bromocresol green methyl red indicator to the 100 mL of sample in your round flask. Mix the color indicator and sample by swirling until the sample color is a vivid blue color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace the round flask filled with the colored sample under the burette filled with 0.02 N sulfuric acid. Be sure the burrette is filled completely to the 0mL line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you are ready to being titrating, carefully and slowly turn the handle on the burette to dispense the sulfuric acid reagent into the sample while swirling the flask at the same time.

To be more accurate you may pipette the small amount of water you may need into or out of the round flask. Remember to have let the sample warm to room temperature.    The next step would be to add around 12 drops of  Bromocresol green methyl red indicator to the 100 mL of sample in your round flask.

A pH reading of less than 7 indicates acidity, whereas a pH of greater than 7 indicates a base.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nThis procedure involves calibrating the pH meter and testing both a raw and tap water sample.\n\n\n\n\nMaterials \n Equipment Needed\n\n\n\n\nThermo Orion meter (fluoride \n pH)\n\n\npH probe\n\n\ntemperature probe\n\n\nHot plate\n\n\npH buffer(4 \n 7 standard)\n\n\n5 small cups\n\n\n4 small mixing magnets\n\n\nReagent grade water\n\n\nTap, raw, or distribution water sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Safety\n\n\nWash hands thoroughly once you are done using the pH buffers.\n\n\n\n\nOperation Warnings\n\n\nNone. \n\n\n\n\nSpecial Notes\n\n\nEvery time the pH meter is calibrated, the results need to be logged in a book along with the date, lot number from each buffer's box , and your initials.\n\n\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step you will have to do is to collect your samples and allow it to warm to room temperature. Then turn on your Thermo Orion meter which can be used to read many different things but for this test you will want to make sure that the pH cable that connects to the prob is hooked up to the back of the meter. Turn on the meter and press either the up or down arrow until the meter is reading pH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've done this you will take the 4 mixing magnets and place one into four of the small cups. Two of these cups will be for your samples, one for one buffer , and the final for the other buffer. The two cups for the buffers may be filled about half way at this time. Again one of the cups gets filled halfway with the 4 buffer which is red in color and the other with 7 buffer which is yellow in color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore preforming the test you must calibrate the meter to ensure accurate results. Remove the probe from the electrode storage solution and rinse off both the pH and temperature probes using the reagent grade water while collecting the waste water with one of the empty cups. Place the cup with the 4 buffer onto the hotplate but for this procedure you will only be using the magnetic mixer dial and not the heating element. On the meter you will press the calibrate button and place the probe into the buffer. The probe will take a little time to calibrate but should finish very closely to 4.0 but might differ from buffer lots . Once it has reached 4.0  you will press the calibration button again so the meter knows that you are calibrating with a second buffer now. Remove the probe from the 4 buffer and rinse. Now place the 7 buffer cup onto the hotplate and insert the probe into the buffer. Again this will take a little time to calibrate but should finish very closely to 7.0 and once it does you will press the save/measure and print button. Remove probe from the buffer solution and rinse off again. You are ready to begin testing your sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that the meter is calibrated you can ready your samples. In order to get your samples ready you will need to fill one of your small cups about half way with your raw water sample and the other about half way with your tap water sample. Place either sample cup onto the hotplate first and insert both probes. The meter will read the sample until the pH symbol stops blinking. Even after the symbol stops blinking it is wise to allow some time to pass with both probes still in the sample in case the pH might move around. After you've recorded your first sample, remove both probes and rinse with the reagent grade water. Now you are ready for your next sample. Just like before place both probes into your sample and wait to record your data. Once the data is recorded remove both probes from the sample and rinse. Place only the pH probe back into its storage solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n\npH Calibration \n Test",

Then you will open up the tiny container of phosphorous reagent and pipette 0.2mL, placing that into the testing tube.    There will be another small container in the phosphorous kit that contains dosi caps. On the inside of these caps there is a power reagent that is used in this test. Place one of the caps on the testing tube and be sure that it is secure. Invert the testing tube at least 20 times to insure that all of the powder reagent mixes in well with the sample solution. For extra assurance that it is mixed well shake on the vortex for a few seconds.    Let the testing tube sit for 10 minutes while the chemical reaction happens. Once 10 minutes is up you will notice a light hint of blue in the testing tube solution. Now on the HACH DR5000 you will exit onto the main menu screen. On the testing tube there is a bar code that is read once placed into the DR5000 facing forward. The results will appear on the screen, then record your data.",

If the sensor is bumped during calibration, it may cause a misread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to go to the computer with the SCADA system on it. Once there you will need to find the screen that has the turbidity meters on it and right click on whichever meter you intend on cleaning and calibrating. Once right clicked you will given a small list of options to pick from, you will need to click on the CI option( Control Inhibit). This means that the meter will pause all readings while you conduct the calibration so no false readings are recorded.\n\n\nThe next step is to ready all of your equipment near the meter you intend working on. Before you start cleaning and calibrating the meter, there is a central meter on the wall that keeps track of all 8 1720D turbidimeters. Once at the homescreen of the central meter, you must find the individual meter you will be working on and select it. Once selected you will follow the options until you reach the calibration confirmation screen.\n\n\nBefore you confirm calibration you must begin the cleaning process. You must lift the sensor head off of the housing unit which is attached to the wall. Carefully hold the sensor head so no water drips onto the wiring or light bulb. Spray the sensory itself with the reagent grade water and wipe down the sensor with paper towel. Once finished, place the sensor head into the calibration cylinder with the reagent water in it until you are ready to place into the calibration standard.\n\n\nCleaning the housing unit will be your next step. The unit will be about half full with water and most likely at the bottom of the meter there will be some algae growth and build up. You will use the chlorine to destroy the algae growth by squirting some chlorine into the unit and scrubbing the inside with the small brush that you are using. After this you will use some of the soapy water solution that you have made and now clean the inside of the unit with that. Repeat the process of scrubbing the unit with the brush. There is a plug on the bottom of the housing unit that you will unplug which will release all of the soapy water. Leave the unit unplugged and use the bottle of reagent grade water to squirt down the inside walls of the unit which will remove all of the soap residue. Once completed plug the unit back up and it will begin to refill with water.\n\n\nCarefully remove the sensor head and place in the calibration cylinder containing the StabCal 20 NTU calibration standard. From there you will go back to the central meter and confirm calibration. This process may take a while to complete but once the number of the screen has stopped very close to 20.0 you know the calibration is complete. If the number is not in a close range to 20.0 the meter will not accept the reading. However if your calibration number is either very close to or on 20.0 the you will be able to choose the confirm calibration option. The meter will have you enter your initials for accountability purposes.\n\n\nAfter completing the calibration you may return to the meter and carefully remove the sensor head from calibration cylinder and place it back into the housing unit. Once this is complete you must return back to the SCADA system and turn off the control inhibitor so the meter can start to collect and record data again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n\nPart 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 3",

Other methods are available, but this method will be discussed in this section.\n\n\n\n\nMaterials \n Equipment Needed\n\n\n\n\nHach DR5000 (instrument)\n\n\n1 cm x 1 cm crystal cuvette\n\n\nReagent Grade Water\n\n\nLint-free wipe / tissue that does not scratch crystal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Safety\n\n\nThere are no personal safety concerns involved in this procedure.\n\n\n\n\nOperation Warnings\n\n\nTesting UV with this instrument will not affect any other process.\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Notes\n\n\nBe very careful handling crystal cuvette because it is very expensive. Also be sure to turn off UV lamp after test is preformed so it does not burn out.\n\n\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\nThis procedure assumes Hach DR5000 instrument is in good working order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the Hach DR5000 you need to get to the main menu screen. From there choose instrument set up option. Choose the lamp set up option and turn on the UV lamp. Give the lamp a few minutes to warm up or until you see the light bulb symbol on the top of the screen stop flashing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake the crystal cuvette and carefully empty the reagent grade water stored in it from previous testing. Fill with fresh reagent grade water for calibration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the lamp is warmed up continue on the main menu screen with the single wave option. After choosing that there is a up arrow option on the lower right hand corner of the screen. Once pressed there will be a column of options, choose the percent transmittance option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlide hatch back and place cuvette into square slot. Then press the zero option on the bottom of the screen. Once zeroed the DR5000 should read 100% trans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove cuvette and empty reagent grade water. Now fill cuvette with post-UV clearwell water sample. Carefully wipe off cuvette before placing it into the square slot inside the instrument. Once the cuvette is placed inside, close the hatch and press the read option on the screen. This will be your UV reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpty the sample out of the cuvette and rinse with reagent grade water. Once rinsed fill back up with reagent grade water and put cap back on the top for storage. Place cuvette into circular holder for next use. Follow directions to get back to UV lamp control screen and shut the lamp off.",

Choose the lamp set up option and turn on the UV lamp. Give the lamp a few minutes to warm up or until you see the light bulb symbol on the top of the screen stop flashing.    Take the crystal cuvette and carefully empty the reagent grade water stored in it from previous testing. Fill with fresh reagent grade water for calibration.    Once the lamp is warmed up continue on the main menu screen with the single wave option. After choosing that there is a up arrow option on the lower right hand corner of the screen. Once pressed there will be a column of options, choose the percent transmittance option.    Slide hatch back and place cuvette into square slot. Then press the zero option on the bottom of the screen. Once zeroed the DR5000 should read 100% trans.    Remove cuvette and empty reagent grade water. Now fill cuvette with post-UV clearwell water sample. Carefully wipe off cuvette before placing it into the square slot inside the instrument. Once the cuvette is placed inside, close the hatch and press the read option on the screen. This will be your UV reading.    Empty the sample out of the cuvette and rinse with reagent grade water. Once rinsed fill back up with reagent grade water and put cap back on the top for storage. Place cuvette into circular holder for next use. Follow directions to get back to UV lamp control screen and shut the lamp off.",

Although distribution storage facilities are not under the care of the Commission, we are responsible for operating its valves and pumps to regulate pressure while reserving a portion of the tank for fire protection. Maintaining distribution pressure is essential to operations. Too much pressure can lead to main breaks or equipment damage; not enough pressure can lead to customer complaints and diminished fire protection; quick changes (high or low) can cause water hammer- a force that causes main breaks. \n\n\nTwo additional aspects of operations is energy usage and water quality. Various pumps and valves typically operate strategically to minimize electrical demand fees. While running equipment, we also need to be cognizant of water age- water in our storage facilities needs to \"turn over\" to prevent a deterioration in water quality. If a tower is out of service for an extended period of time, it may not be potable and may require disposal. \n\n\nIn operating such equipment, one should note that individual pieces of equipment can operate in manual or auto. For instance, high service pump #1 can be set to run in manual at a specific speed (keypad); it can also run in auto to change the speed to meet a pressure setpoint.

Some of the infrastructure is old and brittle while other parts are new and robust. To minimize damage, the following operating techniques must be observed:\n\n\n\n\nDistribution Valve Operation\n\n\n\n\nThe valves controlled by the NSWC can be remotely operated (i.e. electric actuators controlled by SCADA system). Opening and closing a distribution valve will cause a pressure change- locally and globally. When changing the valve position, the Operator must control motion to prevent large changes in pressure. In auto, the SCADA system regulates motion without further operator interaction. In manual, operators must control motion by modulating the valve open percentage by 1% per 30 seconds (or slower). \n\n\n\n\nPlant Valve Operation\n\n\n\n\nThe plant valves associated with the high service pumps are normally controlled automatically. In the past, operators have noted problems with these valves, especially those associated with high service pumps 2 and 3. In the event of control failure, operators must use the controls at the valve actuators. If you intend to start the pump, the valve actuator must be opened after pump start-up. If you intend to stop the pump, the valve actuator must be closed before pump shut-down. If this order is not used, water will flow through the pump backwards and potentially cause damage. \n\n\n\n\nHigh Service Pump Operation\n\n\n\n\nWhen in auto, the pump designated as Rank 1 will be running or called to run. This pump will operate from its minimum speed to its maximum speed in order to meet the target discharge pressure. If Rank 1 pump cannot meet the target pressure, Rank 2 pump is called to run. If the Rank 2 pump do3es not start or cannot sustain the pressure, the next higher pump rank will start. This process repeats until enough pumps are on to handle demand. \n\n\nIf pressure settings and/or schedules are adjusted, care must be taken to prevent unnecessary start and stopping of pumps as this will cause a transient pressure spike. Direct (manual operation) or indirect (SCADA setting) pump changes should be made in such a way to limit the frequency of pump changes to less than 1 pump change per 60 minutes under normal circumstances and 1 pump change per 5 minutes under extraordinary circumstances. \n\n\nIn the event of an extraordinary event (power outage, malfunction, etc.) it is expected that an operator will make every effort to restore high service pressure to the target range as quickly as possible- even if this means frequent pump changes. \n\n\n\n\nDistribution Pump Operation\n\n\n\n\nWhen in auto, the pumps will start and stop according to the various settings and schedules associated with each utility. In general, the pump and fill valve operate at different times: the fill valve is modulating when the pump is off and vice versa. Like any other pump, starting and stopping the pump will cause a transient pressure spike. Pump changes should be made in such a way to limit the frequency of pump changes to less than 1 pump change per 60 minutes under normal circumstances and 5 minutes under extraordinary circumstances. \n\n\nUnder very rare circumstances, the high service pumps may be isolated to deal with equipment downstream. In these rare events, it will be necessary to run the entire system off distribution pumps. \n\n\n\n\nEnergy Management\n\n\n\n\nEnergy management is important in our attempt to minimize electical cost. Various setting and schedules are designed",

In the event of control failure, operators must use the controls at the valve actuators. If you intend to start the pump, the valve actuator must be opened after pump start-up. If you intend to stop the pump, the valve actuator must be closed before pump shut-down. If this order is not used, water will flow through the pump backwards and potentially cause damage.    High Service Pump Operation   When in auto, the pump designated as Rank 1 will be running or called to run. This pump will operate from its minimum speed to its maximum speed in order to meet the target discharge pressure. If Rank 1 pump cannot meet the target pressure, Rank 2 pump is called to run. If the Rank 2 pump do3es not start or cannot sustain the pressure, the next higher pump rank will start. This process repeats until enough pumps are on to handle demand.   If pressure settings and/or schedules are adjusted, care must be taken to prevent unnecessary start and stopping of pumps as this will cause a transient pressure spike. Direct (manual operation) or indirect (SCADA setting) pump changes should be made in such a way to limit the frequency of pump changes to less than 1 pump change per 60 minutes under normal circumstances and 1 pump change per 5 minutes under extraordinary circumstances.   In the event of an extraordinary event (power outage, malfunction, etc.) it is expected that an operator will make every effort to restore high service pressure to the target range as quickly as possible- even if this means frequent pump changes.    Distribution Pump Operation   When in auto, the pumps will start and stop according to the various settings and schedules associated with each utility. In general, the pump and fill valve operate at different times: the fill valve is modulating when the pump is off and vice versa. Like any other pump, starting and stopping the pump will cause a transient pressure spike. Pump changes should be made in such a way to limit the frequency of pump changes to less than 1 pump change per 60 minutes under normal circumstances and 5 minutes under extraordinary circumstances.   Under very rare circumstances, the high service pumps may be isolated to deal with equipment downstream. In these rare events, it will be necessary to run the entire system off distribution pumps.    Energy Management   Energy management is important in our attempt to minimize electical cost. Various setting and schedules are designed",
