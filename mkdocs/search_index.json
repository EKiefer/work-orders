The probe will take a little time to calibrate but should finish very closely to 4.0 but might differ from buffer lots . Once it has reached 4.0  you will press the calibration button again so the meter knows that you are calibrating with a second buffer now. Remove the probe from the 4 buffer and rinse. Now place the 7 buffer cup onto the hotplate and insert the probe into the buffer.

Once you open your phosphorous kit, you will get out one of the testing tubes which contains a reagent. You will discard the green factory cap and in doing this be sure not to spill any of the liquid reagent in the tube.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next step will be to pipette 2 mL of your tap water sample into the testing tube using the 1 mL pipette twice. Then you will open up the tiny container of phosphorous reagent and pipette 0.2mL, placing that into the testing tube.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be another small container in the phosphorous kit that contains dosi caps. On the inside of these caps there is a power reagent that is used in this test. Place one of the caps on the testing tube and be sure that it is secure. Invert the testing tube at least 20 times to insure that all of the powder reagent mixes in well with the sample solution. For extra assurance that it is mixed well shake on the vortex for a few seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet the testing tube sit for 10 minutes while the chemical reaction happens. Once 10 minutes is up you will notice a light hint of blue in the testing tube solution. Now on the HACH DR5000 you will exit onto the main menu screen. On the testing tube there is a bar code that is read once placed into the DR5000 facing forward.

The next step will be to pipette 2 mL of your tap water sample into the testing tube using the 1 mL pipette twice. Then you will open up the tiny container of phosphorous reagent and pipette 0.2mL, placing that into the testing tube.     There will be another small container in the phosphorous kit that contains dosi caps. On the inside of these caps there is a power reagent that is used in this test. Place one of the caps on the testing tube and be sure that it is secure. Invert the testing tube at least 20 times to insure that all of the powder reagent mixes in well with the sample solution. For extra assurance that it is mixed well shake on the vortex for a few seconds.     Let the testing tube sit for 10 minutes while the chemical reaction happens. Once 10 minutes is up you will notice a light hint of blue in the testing tube solution. Now on the HACH DR5000 you will exit onto the main menu screen.

Check the MSDS or safety data sheet for personal safety data information.\n\n\n\n\nOperation Warnings\n\n\nBefore performing this calibration, the SCADA system should be set up to \"control inhibit\" this value. When the instrument is working properly, the \"control inhibit\" needs to be taken off.\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Notes\n\n\nThis is Part 1 of a 2-part series. Watch both parts for the whole procedure.\n\n\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\n\n\nTurn off the sample flow to the turbidimeter.\n\n\nPlace a container underneath the turbidimeter body if you don't want the floor below to get wet--this step is optional. Remove the drain plug from the bottom of the body (release the lock on the bottom of the plug and move the plug back and forth to ease it out) and drain the turbidimeter body.\n\n\nCAUTION: DO NOT GET LAMP WET WHEN DOING THIS STEP. Clean turbidimeter sensor with lab soap. If there is a microbiological growth on the instrument, use a little bleach. If using bleach, do not allow bleach to sit on sensor any longer than necessary and clean with lab soap again.

If the sensor is bumped during calibration, it may cause a misread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to go to the computer with the SCADA system on it. Once there you will need to find the screen that has the turbidity meters on it and right click on whichever meter you intend on cleaning and calibrating. Once right clicked you will given a small list of options to pick from, you will need to click on the CI option( Control Inhibit). This means that the meter will pause all readings while you conduct the calibration so no false readings are recorded.\n\n\nThe next step is to ready all of your equipment near the meter you intend working on. Before you start cleaning and calibrating the meter, there is a central meter on the wall that keeps track of all 8 1720D turbidimeters. Once at the homescreen of the central meter, you must find the individual meter you will be working on and select it. Once selected you will follow the options until you reach the calibration confirmation screen.\n\n\nBefore you confirm calibration you must begin the cleaning process. You must lift the sensor head off of the housing unit which is attached to the wall. Carefully hold the sensor head so no water drips onto the wiring or light bulb. Spray the sensory itself with the reagent grade water and wipe down the sensor with paper towel. Once finished, place the sensor head into the calibration cylinder with the reagent water in it until you are ready to place into the calibration standard.\n\n\nCleaning the housing unit will be your next step. The unit will be about half full with water and most likely at the bottom of the meter there will be some algae growth and build up. You will use the chlorine to destroy the algae growth by squirting some chlorine into the unit and scrubbing the inside with the small brush that you are using. After this you will use some of the soapy water solution that you have made and now clean the inside of the unit with that. Repeat the process of scrubbing the unit with the brush. There is a plug on the bottom of the housing unit that you will unplug which will release all of the soapy water. Leave the unit unplugged and use the bottle of reagent grade water to squirt down the inside walls of the unit which will remove all of the soap residue. Once completed plug the unit back up and it will begin to refill with water.\n\n\nCarefully remove the sensor head and place in the calibration cylinder containing the StabCal 20 NTU calibration standard. From there you will go back to the central meter and confirm calibration. This process may take a while to complete but once the number of the screen has stopped very close to 20.0 you know the calibration is complete. If the number is not in a close range to 20.0 the meter will not accept the reading. However if your calibration number is either very close to or on 20.0 the you will be able to choose the confirm calibration option. The meter will have you enter your initials for accountability purposes.\n\n\nAfter completing the calibration you may return to the meter and carefully remove the sensor head from calibration cylinder and place it back into the housing unit. Once this is complete you must return back to the SCADA system and turn off the control inhibitor so the meter can start to collect and record data again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n\nPart 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 3",

The goal of the water treatment plant operator is to ensure that none of these pathogens are present in the finished water to infect the customers. However, testing the water for the presence of each type of waterborne pathogen is too time consuming and expensive to be feasible. Instead, operators test for the presence of one or a few indicator microorganisms which are usually present when pathogens are present.\n\n\nThe most commonly used indicator microorganisms are coliform bacteria, Coliform bacteria live in soils, on vegetation, in surface water and they are universally present in large numbers in the feces of warm-blooded animals (E. coli).  While coliforms themselves do not normally cause serious illness, they are easy to culture and their presence is used to indicate that other pathogenic organisms of fecal origin may be present. Such pathogens include bacteria, viruses, or protozoa and many multicellular parasites. Thus, the presence of coliform bacteria provide evidence that water has been polluted with sewage, and also indicates the possible presence of pathogenic microbes.\n\n\n\n\nOperation

            "text": "There are dozens of types of waterborne pathogens which can be spread in drinking water. The goal of the water treatment plant operator is to ensure that none of these pathogens are present in the finished water to infect the customers. However, testing the water for the presence of each type of waterborne pathogen is too time consuming and expensive to be feasible. Instead, operators test for the presence of one or a few indicator microorganisms which are usually present when pathogens are present.  The most commonly used indicator microorganisms are coliform bacteria, Coliform bacteria live in soils, on vegetation, in surface water and they are universally present in large numbers in the feces of warm-blooded animals (E. coli).  While coliforms themselves do not normally cause serious illness, they are easy to culture and their presence is used to indicate that other pathogenic organisms of fecal origin may be present. Such pathogens include bacteria, viruses, or protozoa and many multicellular parasites. Thus, the presence of coliform bacteria provide evidence that water has been polluted with sewage, and also indicates the possible presence of pathogenic microbes.",

Although distribution storage facilities are not under the care of the Commission, we are responsible for operating its valves and pumps to regulate pressure while reserving a portion of the tank for fire protection. Maintaining distribution pressure is essential to operations. Too much pressure can lead to main breaks or equipment damage; not enough pressure can lead to customer complaints and diminished fire protection; quick changes (high or low) can cause water hammer- a force that causes main breaks. \n\n\nTwo additional aspects of operations is energy usage and water quality. Various pumps and valves typically operate strategically to minimize electrical demand fees. While running equipment, we also need to be cognizant of water age- water in our storage facilities needs to \"turn over\" to prevent a deterioration in water quality. If a tower is out of service for an extended period of time, it may not be potable and may require disposal. \n\n\nIn operating such equipment, one should note that individual pieces of equipment can operate in manual or auto. For instance, high service pump #1 can be set to run in manual at a specific speed (keypad); it can also run in auto to change the speed to meet a pressure setpoint. Because of the complexity of the entire system, there are \"global\" settings designed to mitigate operational problems. These global settings are managed through schedules. \n\n\n\n\nOperational Warnings\n\n\nThe following equipment/infrastructure are affected (note- this list may not be exhaustive):\n\n\n\n\nHigh service pumps 1-5\n\n\nBackwash pumps 1-2\n\n\nSurge relief valve (high service 5 to clearwell)\n\n\nWFB fill valve and pump\n\n\nGlendale fill valve and pumpt\n\n\nFPT fill valves and pumps\n\n\nInterconnections at Green Tree, Henry Clay, and School Road\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Safety\n\n\nAll operations occur via SCADA system or local operator interfaces.

Some of the infrastructure is old and brittle while other parts are new and robust. To minimize damage, the following operating techniques must be observed:\n\n\n\n\nDistribution Valve Operation\n\n\n\n\nThe valves controlled by the NSWC can be remotely operated (i.e. electric actuators controlled by SCADA system). Opening and closing a distribution valve will cause a pressure change- locally and globally. When changing the valve position, the Operator must control motion to prevent large changes in pressure. In auto, the SCADA system regulates motion without further operator interaction. In manual, operators must control motion by modulating the valve open percentage by 1% per 30 seconds (or slower). \n\n\n\n\nPlant Valve Operation\n\n\n\n\nThe plant valves associated with the high service pumps are normally controlled automatically. In the past, operators have noted problems with these valves, especially those associated with high service pumps 2 and 3. In the event of control failure, operators must use the controls at the valve actuators. If you intend to start the pump, the valve actuator must be opened after pump start-up. If you intend to stop the pump, the valve actuator must be closed before pump shut-down. If this order is not used, water will flow through the pump backwards and potentially cause damage. \n\n\n\n\nHigh Service Pump Operation\n\n\n\n\nWhen in auto, the pump designated as Rank 1 will be running or called to run. This pump will operate from its minimum speed to its maximum speed in order to meet the target discharge pressure. If Rank 1 pump cannot meet the target pressure, Rank 2 pump is called to run. If the Rank 2 pump do3es not start or cannot sustain the pressure, the next higher pump rank will start. This process repeats until enough pumps are on to handle demand. \n\n\nIf pressure settings and/or schedules are adjusted, care must be taken to prevent unnecessary start and stopping of pumps as this will cause a transient pressure spike. Direct (manual operation) or indirect (SCADA setting) pump changes should be made in such a way to limit the frequency of pump changes to less than 1 pump change per 60 minutes under normal circumstances and 1 pump change per 5 minutes under extraordinary circumstances. \n\n\nIn the event of an extraordinary event (power outage, malfunction, etc.) it is expected that an operator will make every effort to restore high service pressure to the target range as quickly as possible- even if this means frequent pump changes. \n\n\n\n\nDistribution Pump Operation\n\n\n\n\nWhen in auto, the pumps will start and stop according to the various settings and schedules associated with each utility. In general, the pump and fill valve operate at different times: the fill valve is modulating when the pump is off and vice versa. Like any other pump, starting and stopping the pump will cause a transient pressure spike. Pump changes should be made in such a way to limit the frequency of pump changes to less than 1 pump change per 60 minutes under normal circumstances and 5 minutes under extraordinary circumstances. \n\n\nUnder very rare circumstances, the high service pumps may be isolated to deal with equipment downstream. In these rare events, it will be necessary to run the entire system off distribution pumps. \n\n\n\n\nEnergy Management\n\n\n\n\nEnergy management is important in our attempt to minimize electical cost. Various setting and schedules are designed not only to address water storage and pressure issues, they are designed to minimize electrical consumption. Every attempt should be made to use 300kW or less while on-peak at the Bender facility (low demand periods). We are charged a fee for every kW that exceeds 300- done on a monthly basis. Every attempt should be made to use the least amount of energy at Klode (there is no kW target at Klode). \n\n\nBoth Bender and Klode facilities are charged a fee based on the greatest electrical demand over the past 12 months- regardless of on-peak or off-peak. In other words, running an extra 100 kW for 10 minutes could result in elevated fees for an entire year!\n\n\nStategies for minimizing elecrical demand include: using the towers to steady the flow, starting and stopping equipment off-peak (i.e. UV system), filling towers at night, avoid pump maintenance/testing during on-peak, running the generator whenever there is an expectation of high energy use, and running one high pump whenever possible (do not run additional high service pumps during on-peak unless absolutely necessary). \n\n\nNote- on-peak at Bender is from 10:00am to 10:00pm, Monday through Friday. On-peak at Klode is 9:00am to 9:00pm, Mondary through Friday. Posted holidays are excluded from on-peak periods. \n\n\n\n\nSpecial Notes\n\n\nNone at this time.",

At the time this document was prepared, this equipment is borrowed from the City of Glendale and is called the \u201cPower Walk.\u201d Valves can also be turned manually using standard valve key. Valves have to be turned clockwise to close and counter clockwise to open.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify all of the following valves on drawings and mark/note their corresponding location outside.  \n\n\n\n\nNW Reservoir - Influent - 42 turns\n\n\nNW Reservoir - Effluent - 43.9 turns  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaving all reservoir valves open. Put the raw water pump to lowest possible speed (raw #2 or #4). Drain the reservoir level down to about 6 to 8 feet of water. This process will take about 24 to 36 hours to accomplish.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen reservoirs are pumped down to required height. Close first the influent valve and then the effluent valve to the northwest reservoir. Monitor water quality coming out of reservoirs. If there is an increase in turbidity initially, it is probably due to rust coming off of valves. Note if turbidity increases during operational events or during rain events. Turbidity should be monitored by grab samples once every hour by staff until turbidity is confirmed to be stable and normal. Increases to turbidity during operational events and rain events may indicate a problem within the non-draining \nreservoirs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter reservoir has been isolated. Turn up the speed of the raw water pump in service and fill the open reservoirs up to required height (approx. 14 feet) for normal daily operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the west hatch cover of the northwest reservoir (this hatch does not have the reservoir height sensing equipment mounted in it). Set up the gantry, run pump, necessary power and hoses to pump the remaining water out of the reservoir. (Note: there will still be about a foot of water in the reservoir when the reservoir is considered to be drained.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional:  When draining reservoir is drained. Do a walk through inspection of reservoir. You will need: knee high rubber boats, flashlight, air quality monitor and confine space equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter reservoir has been inspected by NSWC employees and there are no need for repairs. Schedule an inspection, from an independent contractor. This is normally scheduled prior to draining reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the reservoir has passed inspection. The reservoir needs to be chlorinated, refilled and pass a colilert test before opening up the valves and putting back into service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time reservoir is being filled and chlorinated. The clearwell chlorine residual set point should be lowered to about 2.40 ppm. This will help keep the combined total chlorine residual lower when the northeast reservoir valves are opened and the water, with the higher chlorine residual, is mixed  with the water from the other 3 basins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo chlorinate the reservoir, you will need: peristaltic pump capable of pumping 17 gal/day, \u215c\u201d plastic tubing, 100 gal tank with 43 gals of sodium hypochlorite, 1 \u00bd\u201d diameter clean fire hose and plastic premade injector/discharge tee. Attach the pump and the hypochlorite tank to the plastic tee using \u215c\u201d plastic tubing. Attach fire hose to nearest fire hydrant and then to the plastic tee. With the pump set up to feed the hypochlorite into the water supply, open up fire hydrant all the way and turn on pump to feed 17 gal/day. Let water and hypo pump run for approximately 3 days or over a weekend until there is about 5 feet of water in reservoir. There should be about a 20 ppm residual of chlorine in the reservoir. Test the water to make sure that the required chlorine residual has been met.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter required chlorine residual has been met. Fill the reservoir to 12 feet. (Note: Before filling reservoir, make sure the height of the other reservoirs in service are higher than 13 feet.) To fill the northwest reservoir open the influent valve 42 turns. Then open the effluent valve about 10 turns. Let the reservoir fill with high service water. When required height is met. Close the effluent valve and then the influent valve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet the reservoir sit for 24 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the 24 hours, test the chlorine residual in the reservoir. Chlorine residual must be below 10 ppm to run a colilert test. Let reservoir sit until required chlorine residual has been obtained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter chlorine residual has dropped below 10 ppm. Collect sample for the colilert test. Collect the sample using a submersible pump and clean plastic tubing. Place submersible pump into reservoir and let run for about one hour. Then collect 100 ml sample of the reservoir water into a sterilized Idexx collection bottle. Run one colilert test, two consecutive days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the reservoir has passed the colilert tests and the chlorine residual is about 7 ppm, the influent valve can now be opened 42 turns. Allow the reservoir to reach the same height as the reservoirs in service. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen reservoir heights have equalized. Open the effluent valve about 7 turns. This will allow the higher chlorine levels to mix with the high service reservoir water.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitor high service chlorine residual. Residual must not exceed 4 ppm. Optimally residual should not go higher than 3 ppm. Open or close effluent valve to get optimal chlorine residual. Once chlorine residual is obtained, maintain the valve position and monitor the high service chlorine residual until residual has come down to normal levels about 2.50 ppm. This process may take between 1 to 7 days to achieve depending on the high service demand and chlorine residual of the water in the northwest reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen normal chlorine residuals are reached, slowly open the effluent valve (one turn at a time) until high service chlorine residual raises again. Then repeat step 17 until the effluent valve is fully open.",

We are in the process of acquiring new level indicators for the bulk tanks in the basement, and we just recalibrated the polyphosphate tank. We have a long road ahead of us in fixing these numbers\u2014possibly taking until the end of summer before completion of this project.\n\n\n\n\nManual Measurement\n\n\nTo find out what the \u201creal\u201d numbers are, we need to take manual measurements of the tank levels and then manually calculate the pounds of chemical. There are 2 instances where taking measurements are very important.\n\n\nDaily Sheet\n- \nThe DNR wants to know how much chemical we feed every day. Currently, we record information every round. Until further notice we will record the sight tube level (and calculated pounds) in addition to the computer reading. This way we can compare the two measurements, assuming the manual measurement is more accurate.\n\n\nChemical Transfer\n- \nWhen there is a chemical transfer, we need to record the levels before and after a transfer. Automatic transfers are going to be disabled so that you can record the levels accurately.\n\n\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\nThe daily sheet has been modified to provide a convenient place for you to record all of this new information. Additional worksheets are also available for help in making computations.\n\n\nDaily Round Sheet\n\n\nEvery round, all the chemicals (except KMnO4) need to be recorded in the following way:\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of your round, record active chemical pounds from the computer screen to the daily sheet. Record as CPU #.\n\n\nWhen doing the inspection of the plant, record the inches of chemical in each day chemical tank. Record as INCHES.\n\n\nAt the end of the round, do the calculation to convert to active pounds of chemicals. See worksheet for help in making computation. Record as ACT #.\n\n\n\n\nThe following information also must be recorded during the last round of the day.\n\n\n*At the time of the last round, do round as described above with the following additions:\n\n\n\n\nRecord BULK active chemical pounds from the computer screen to the daily sheet. Record as CPU # (bottom of the sheet, upper row).\n\n\nWhen doing the inspection of the plant, record the inches of chemical in each BULK tank. Record as INCHES (bottom of the sheet, upper row).\n\n\nAt the end of the round, do the calculation to convert to active pounds of chemicals. See worksheet for help in making computation. Record as ACT # (bottom of the sheet, upper row).\n\n\n\n\nChemical Transfers\n\n\nIn order to accurate measure before and after a fill, the automatic transfer of chemicals will be disabled. There will only be two ways for you to know when to transfer chemicals.\n\n\n\n\nThe low level alarm will sound.\n\n\nOn your round, you may notice the day tank level is low.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you notice you need to transfer chemical, proceed with the following procedure.\n\n\n\n\nRecord the DAY tank active chemical pounds from the computer screen to the daily sheet. Record as CPU # (bottom of the sheet, middle row).\n\n\nMeasure the inches of chemical in the DAY tank.
